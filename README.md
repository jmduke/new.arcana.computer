# new.arcana.computer

(At some point, I'll archive the [old site](https://github.com/jmduke/arcana.computer) and rename this one.)

## Stack

- This is built primarily using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).
- I use [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling and a healthy dose of [Heroicons](http://heroicons.com) for icons.
- This site is deployed through [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).
- Almost all of the data is either authored using [MDX](http://mdxjs.com); structured content like my content catalogs are stored in [Airtable](http://airtable.com).
