            <description><![CDATA[<p>This is very much an album about what it means to have spent twenty years making music that is almost entirely about being in your late twenties and feeling that the most important parts of life are happening and fleeting. It is soft and comforting and you can&#39;t help but feel that, outside of the impressiveness that you&#39;re listening to it at all (I remember seeing Stars in DC in, what, 2010, and being blown away!) it feels a bit hollow, a bit like a cove</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>My only memory of Mallrat was listening to <em>For Real</em> a few hundred times back in 2016, so this album was not really what I expected — wavier and dreamier. One terrible Azealia Banks verse aside, I liked it quite a bit: relaxing, sweet, and dreamlike without being gratuitous.</p>

This feels sparser, muter, and less interesting, though still nice.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>It&#39;s not a masterpiece like the 2010 original, but — separated from its musical trappings — feels like something of a well-executed live action reboot. There are moments of repetition and subtext turned into text and those things aren&#39;t great, but it feels <em>good</em> to spend more time in this world, and to drink a bit more of it than usual. (And the execution is tremendous, too, even if I miss Anais and Justin&#39;s original vocals.)</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Mostly a reminder that Anais Mitchell is perfect and I need to listen to her more often. Less glibly, I thought this was as good-not-great as a side project gets: it suffers from lack of gestalt (as evinced by the lackluster second half) but the songs are pleasant and good even if they don&#39;t quite cohere.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>This is not the best Ben-Gibbard-related live album (that is the inimitable <em>The John Byrd EP</em>), and it feels strictly inferior to <em>Give Up</em>, but as far as live albums go it is warm and pleasantly produced and I listened to it three times straight which is a pretty good sign.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Every year, the Jose Gonzales Trio put on a live performance of the Charlie Brown Christmas soundtrack to raise funds for the Strawshop Theatre (a troupe of which I&#39;m a fairly ardent supporter.) It is perhaps my favorite part of Christmas, and this is a recorded version of that music.  And, I mean, I <em>love these guys</em> but there&#39;s no improving on the original.</p>
