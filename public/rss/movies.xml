            <description><![CDATA[<p>The set-pieces were really good. Daniel Craig and Jeffrey Wright were really good. Ana de Armas was <em>exceptional</em>. I had a fun time!</p>
<p>And yet. Movies with the run time that this one had really need to <em>earn</em> that extra forty-five minutes. I don&#39;t think this one did. It played around with two metatextual ideas that I am of course a sucker for:</p>
<ol>
<li>The idea of Bond (or, more broadly, all action stars) being obsoleted by technology &amp; modernity;</li>
<li>The idea of Bond being a sort of grim King Midas who brings grief &amp; ruin to all he touches.</li>
</ol>
<p>The first item has been discussed to exhaustion by a better firm in [[Skyfall]] and a better plot device in [[Spectre]]; the only difference I think <em>No Time To Die</em> offers is a much different denouement, which I&#39;ll get to in a second.</p>
<p>The second item I think was handled with much more pathos in [[Casino Royale]] (my favorite, and in retrospect probably the greatest, Bond film.) I did enjoy the irony of making that subtext explicit with &quot;nanobots&quot;, and I&#39;m sure the writers felt like they were being very clever when they figured out how to do that.</p>
<p>(A quick aside: Rami Malek&#39;s character was a complete non-factor — a failure of the script, not of his performance, to be clear. I thought Billy Magnussen did a terrific job, and our ability to root for his death &amp; understand his causes were much less opaque.)</p>
<p>About that ending... interesting, and probably the most interesting part of the movie! I don&#39;t know how to interpret it as anything other than a partial admission of the sublimation of the ego into the superstructure (which I of course realize is an insane phrase to assign to a Bond film.) Bond dies, which is both a way for him to give up the ghost and to break once more from the mold of the Bond legacy of decades past. The mission couldn&#39;t be done without him, but it couldn&#39;t be done with <em>just</em> him.</p>
<p>It&#39;s hard not to contrast this final act with [[Top Gun: Maverick]], a movie I watched a week prior to this one. That film&#39;s thesis was, bluntly and exuberantly: <em>Action movies are perfect; action heroes are here forever.</em> Craig&#39;s run as Bond has been a bit of a deconstruction of that, and this is the third such explicit deconstruction. I liked <em>Top Gun: Maverick</em> more, and at the end of the day I think it&#39;s more because you need much more justification &amp; license for melancholy and irony than you do for exuberance and joy.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>I’m surprised that this movie is held in such high esteem relative to other Hitchcock films. I liked it, and I thought there were very good parts of it, and I thought it was better than Haley did. But it didn’t strike me as one of his best films beyond the dolly shot which is now of course classic (maybe the infamy of that shot robs the film of some of its staying power, since its influence has now been diffused amongst the rest of cinema?) or the climactic two scenes: the rotating embrace between Judy and Scottie or the doomed ascent up the clock-tower.</p>
<p>What worked particularly well for me in the film (and I’d say less so for Haley) was the descent of Jimmy Stewart. I am a sucker for these sorts of meta-referential roles, the collapse of an American icon into a stalker and out-and-out shell. I think there is a message here that I need to sit and digest a bit more to understand completely (as opposed to, say, [[Rear Window]], which was pretty clear in its undertones about consumption &amp; the role of the audience.)</p>
<p>Roger Ebert’s retrospective review was fairly kind to the film, and I think hinted at what I’m getting at but in a similar vague way: he describes this as a sort of ur-Hitchcock, with the message being in relation to how Hitchcock views the world and views women. I thought that was a useful lens, but again — it still escapes me somewhat.</p>
<p>A welcome piece of this film that I forgot to touch upon until just now, though: <em>San Francisco</em>. What a perfect choice of setting and location, and Hitchcock dotes equally on the steep neon-clad streets and the esoteric landscapes just out of the city. </p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>I went into this movie equipped with two pieces of baggage:</p>
<ol>
<li>I had watched the predecessor the night before, so the plot beats, overt propagandizing, and rampant homoerotic tension was fresh in my mind.</li>
<li>I knew from a friend that it was as much of a critical darling as could be hoped (at the time of my viewing, it was sitting at around a 97% on Rotten Tomatoes) as well as a crowd-pleaser.</li>
</ol>
<p>For the first two thirds of the movie, I was a bit flabbergasted at the latter. It felt rote and plastic; yes, Tom Cruise was playing a twenty-year old at the age of fifty and clearly giving it his all, but — why? It felt like a cosplay of the previous film, down to replacing one inert love interest with another. And I so <em>hate</em> the tendency for these films to try and bridge the gap between &quot;beloved old movie&quot; and &quot;hot new IP&quot; by bringing back the star, having them mentor some folks, and then dying off or sailing into the sunset.</p>
<p>Where this movie turned the corner [^1] for me was the climactic two runs of what I&#39;ll call the &quot;Top Gun Kessel Run&quot;. It was a very good choice to replace the &quot;abstract competition with points&quot; in the original film with a specific objective that the trainees fail in interesting and revealing ways, and then that choice is rewarded with both Tom Cruises&#39; hypersonic completion of the run (it&#39;s much clearer to say &quot;oh he did it in 2:15 instead of 3:00&quot; than &quot;uhhh he did a really cool maneuver&quot;), but also the <em>incredible</em> action sequence of the live TGKR, which was just some of the best action filmmaking I&#39;ve seen in my life.</p>
<p>This was not a mastery of film, and I think the critical gulf between reviews of this movie and reviews of the original is a bit of a make-up call for what was in retrospect a deeply odd and impactful bit of American mythos. But it was a better one, and it&#39;s certainly very fun. </p>
<p>Some stray observations:</p>
<ul>
<li>I assume an earlier draft of this script had more focus on the whittling down of 12 trainees to six, because boy did that have no impact on the actual plot. I&#39;m honestly impressed with the surgical precision by which the eight redshirt trainees were excised from the actual film!</li>
<li>Glen Powell is a great actor, and the deployment of him as Waluigi Maverick was apt.</li>
<li>Speaking of deployments: I hated the Lady Gaga original track, but thought the use of the church bell from <em>Take My Breath Away</em> as a bit of a aural motif was brilliant.</li>
</ul>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>This is no retrospective of a beloved childhood film through adult eyes or anything like that: I know this movie for its myriad backwards-references, and I know this movie for <em>Highway to the Danger Zone</em>, and I know this movie for the volleyball scene (in reference, but having never scene it), and we wanted to watch it in preparation for its much-ballyhooed sequel.</p>
<p>It was...pretty good! It was what felt like an ur-machismo movie, for better and for worse. (Or to quote a character in the film: it does a lot of things better [than the average eighties film], and it does a lot of things worse [than the average eighties film]). </p>
<p>Leaving aside the filmmaking-versus-propaganda angle, what was by far the worst part of the film was the plot altogether, which was — what is this competition thing anyway? There&#39;s no propulsion (see what I did there?) from scene to scene; it feels like you are ping-ponging between some very neat flights for which there&#39;s little obvious rhythm or rule and some very sweaty scenes of post-combat posturing and retrospective.</p>
<p>I think what I liked about this movie and what I thought it did well was that it hinted at some truth about male camaraderie, whether its the wingman relationship or the RIO relationship. There&#39;s an earnestness in how it depicts both Goose and Iceman&#39;s relationship to Maverick that I think can be easily forgotten or recontextualized into oblivion; it is very sweet, and mostly a movie about brothers.</p>
<p>(The bolder version of this movie would have been excising the love interest altogether, which feels like some sort of contractual obligation to the viewing public. It&#39;s <em>remarkable</em> how little that subplot brings to the table, besides the kitschy final scene.)</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>This is more than a well-animated (though it is <em>extremely</em> well-animated, and the marked contrast in style between the real world and the digital world is impeccable executed) and well-conceived execution of “what if Beauty and the Beast but in VR?”  I mean, it is that — this reminds me a bit of the early Makoto Shinkai work where there is a bit of a plot but you don’t really care about the plot, the plot is a vehicle for other interesting things, and I think the “interesting things” in this case is not “a bunch of beautiful shots of rain” but “a surprisingly realistic and mature representation of both the benefits and drawbacks of digital escapism.”</p>
<p>I don’t give a shit about the musical numbers — they were fine? kinda boring? — but had a great time. There were two scenes in particular (what I will describe as the “Civ 6 scene” and the “does that mean you have a crush on me? scene”) that were A++ moments that were worth the price of admission alone.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Nothing wrong with this one, and it&#39;s a clear descendant of the Ocean&#39;s Eleven school of thinking: get a really talented cast, add some espionage, and let them have a whole bunch of fun together.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it has the Ocean&#39;s Twelve penchant for narrative confusion as substitute for narrative wit. I thought the slow reveal of parallel timelines was good (and the final twist at the end was nice, in an Agatha Christie &quot;oh, that&#39;s clever!&quot; sense) but it made things a little tricky to actually keep together (for instance, how did Clive Owen&#39;s character even get the formula given that they caught him with it?) or even care about / root for. A good way to spend a Sunday night because it is charming and well-crafted, but does not push the boundary in any particular way.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>The movie is really long. Three hours long! You know that I do not particularly enjoy overlong movies. This one felt like three hours: the opening credits, coming in thirty minutes and after the first act, was half-wink and half-nod at that.</p>
<p>This was a slow movie, but none of the padding — none of the languor — felt inessential. This is a movie about what it feels like to be in the passenger seat on a long car ride, in many respects, and the fact that a solid third of the runtime is quiet shots of the Saab 900 Turbo flitting around Hokkaido is testament to that.</p>
<p>There are a lot of really perfect moments in this movie. The one I will fixate on — the one that made me briefly consider putting this into my canon — was the penultimate one. If you know, you know.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>This was...perfectly competent.</p>
<p>Branagh was okay as Poirot but could not match Suchet (who can?) The acting and cast were stellar in terms of renown and serviceable in terms of talent. The direction was nouveau and gorgeous. And the story (with some tweaks, I&#39;ve gathered, from the original novel, but mostly just to frame this as a successor to Branagh&#39;s previous adaptation) is a bloody classic.</p>
<p>This felt like a very good cover band doing a Poirot adaptation. It was neither a great movie nor a great Poirot adaptation, but wasn&#39;t <em>bad</em> on either lens. If you&#39;re craving a whodunit, this isn&#39;t quite <em>empty</em> calories and is going to be entertaining.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>I wanted to watch this movie first and foremost because of the long-take gymnasium scene that went viral on Twitter, knowing little about the original besides it being a slummy New York take on Romeo and Juliet. I still want to watch the original, but the most singular word I can use to describe this is production was competent: in direction, in choreography, in staging. The two leads do nothing for me (and the musical numbers do nothing to assuage my apathy towards Sondheim) but it was a pretty and smooth piece of work.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Boy, I loved this. This was really really really well executed: a moody, bare, opinionated take on what a film adaptation should be.</p>
<p>I can&#39;t think of a single quibble! The acting was uniformly delightful (Denzel struggled in the first two acts, I think, and then really got going as Macbeth descended further and further) and I now have a newfound respect for Alex Hassell who was a nadir amongst nadirs in [[Cowboy Bebop (2021)]]. The set design and cinematography was by far my favorite piece of the entire thing (just the right number of Dutch angles!) and I appreciated the light touch of whimsy when it came to choose who should portray the Third Murderer.</p>
<p>The only thing keeping me from giving this a perfect rating is an absence of, uh... this is going to sound cliche, but soul? Like this was a perfect stage adaptation of a play, but it was first and foremost a play. I spent the entire runtime agog at how well it was done, but it never turned into its own thing (which is fine — it never wanted nor tried to!)</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>I wasn&#39;t expecting to love this movie as much as I did, but it&#39;s my favorite Wes Anderson. It grabbed my head and my heart by the collar and refused to let go.</p>
<p>I thought there was something a little poetic about his turn to animation in Isle of Dogs — the auteur who was so precious about treating his scenes like meticulous storyboards in a fitting medium at last! — but this actually <em>works even better</em>. He is at his most Wes Anderson-y: the set design is immaculate, the scripts are twee and that particular blend of irony-cum-earnestness, the plotting, rather than being <em>sparse</em>, is altogether absent.</p>
<p>A lot of hay has been made about how Aaron Sorkin&#39;s ouevre only really works when he&#39;s dealing with material that is as pretentious as he is. This is why The West Wing (smart people running the world) and The Social Network (people who think they&#39;re smart and running the world) are fun scripts, and the likes of Molly&#39;s Game &amp; Studio 60 were not.  I think something can be said for Wes Anderson: I (and his actors) will eat up his screenwriting regardless of the setting, but it only feels quasi-revelatory when you can put the words in the mouths of people believably precocious (see The Royal Tenenbaums and Rushmore).</p>
<p>And what&#39;s more precocious than broad and loving caricatures of <em>New Yorker</em> staff writers? This choice, too, is great: what Wes Anderson loses in a sense of narrative propulsion he gains in the power of triptych: each story follows the same quiet little arc of &quot;writer discovering themselves through their subject&quot;, and being bookended by the paternal Bill Murray works  really well.</p>
<p>I&#39;m rambling: I might need to digest more of the movie to have anything more interesting to say. This is never going to be Wes Anderson&#39;s most acclaimed movie but it is the one I loved the most, and I think I will remember it as my favorite even if I will never remember it as the best.</p>

<p>The bad: Doris Day&#39;s hats; a paint-by-numbers third act; a feeling of having seen this all before.</p>
<p>All in all, averages out. There&#39;s no reason to watch this if you&#39;ve already seen [[Pillow Talk]], but there&#39;s no reason to run away from it screaming.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>The film is beautiful and appealing in every sense: the CGI and direction is masterful, and the audial design (both the soundtrack and then backing effects) are terrific. The acting is solid (even Chamalet, who feels a little too <em>modern</em> for this work, bring his A Game). I was riveted watching it. </p>
<p>But the entire thing is a trailer for another movie. Nothing happened, and what happened felt rushed, like a race to cover as many plot points as quickly as possible (is it unfair to accuse the film of both being too boring and too fast, like the Jewish grandmother who says of a meal &quot;terrible — and such small portions!&quot;? perhaps!) It&#39;s hard to say how much of my experience is colored by having read the books, and getting to follow along the plot without much exposition needed (the only person I watched with that <em>hadn&#39;t</em> read the books was Haley, who liked it enough to download the book after the fact.) </p>
<p>But it&#39;s hard not to see a bit of [[Blade Runner 2049]] in this movie, which is to say a commitment to futuristic <em>vibes</em> without actually much of a gestalt tying many of the individually breathtaking settings together. I trust Villeneuve, and perhaps I am salty that one of the most exciting parts of the book — the revelation that the Bene Gesserit planted the messianic legend amongst the Fremen, and the implication that <em>all</em> savior narratives are manufactured — is a throwaway line twenty minutes into the movie. </p>
<p>These are all quibbles. I am eagerly anticipating the second part. But t</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>This movie didn&#39;t have any reason to exist, but if the <em>previous</em> animated Grinch didn&#39;t exist, I think people would like this one a lot! It was well-animated and well-voiced. Max the Dog (and of course Fred the obese reindeer) were very, very endearing. There were a bunch of solid visual sight gags. There&#39;s nothing to really malign besides its lack of raison d&#39;etre.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Some things were good: the &quot;go back in time to change the future&quot; conceit was surprisingly unmuddled (and, despite the conceit&#39;s ubiquity, it felt...unadorned here!); the futuristic Sentinel designs were really, really great (it&#39;s hard to imbue boring evil robots with a true sense of menace!); Fassbender is a terrific actor.</p>
<p>I think there were more things in the movie that I didn&#39;t like than that I did, though. The final act is pretty non-sensical (why didn&#39;t Professor X just control Trask? how come Magneto can control the Sentinels, which were explicitly mentioned as being non-metallic?); the 70&#39;s setting and ham-fisted addiction allegory felt extraneous; a lot of non-Fassbender performances were pretty phoned-in.</p>
<p>Still, it was a romp. Superhero movies can have a lot of extraneous garbage and this was not one of them. There was a clear through-line to the entire enterprise, and the grounding of the melodrama not in Big Bads or anything too cosmic (looking at you, Marvel!) but in interpersonal relationships &amp; agency are what make the X-Men stories so unique and resonant.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>This movie is entirely style over substance, but — what style! It is <em>so</em> fun to watch. The visual motifs are really, really well done, and the script is puerile and predictable but not necessarily <em>bad</em>. Mostly I am struck by how interesting and vivid the world is  — and how many rote plot twists &amp; evolutions you jump through — relative to the short runtime, and it really feels like a sixty hour JRPG compressed into an incredibly stylish film (not that I’m complaining — I think the script’s cliches would have been much more painful on something with a long runtime, but the movie was very good about lampshading all of them.)</p>
<p>Also, the music is incredibly solid.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>I think I was a little spoiled by [[Life is Short, Walk On Girl]] which took everything that the show did and amped it up to ten, rewarding (but not mandating) your understanding of the show&#39;s context and visual language. This was fun — the set pieces were delightful, especially for the time — but the core of the drama revolved around Char and Amuro who I have never seen before. That&#39;s on me, not on the film — but so much of the context felt prerequisite for the emotional arcs.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>This was very, very well done. The Grahame-Bogart interplay was fantastic on both sides: the one shot of them in the throes of lust, sharing a cigarette at a crowded piano bar, is probably the most charming Bogart has ever been. The ending (in its wryness) was a little bit choreographed but I can&#39;t really blame the film for that as much as I blame the film&#39;s influence (or perhaps the fact that I&#39;ve just seen so much noir at this point), and Bogart&#39;s descent into — for lack of a better term — mania was really well done, and something you don&#39;t see a lot of in his earlier work is the gradation in character: not just the stoic mercenary and not just the heartened madman but the whole spectrum ebtween the two.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>This was really good.</p>
<p>It was a great rom-com, for starters. It is in the style of Linklater&#39;s comedies: a long epic bender of a night filled with weird and endearing caricatures. The protagonists are odd and funny and in a timeless way.</p>
<p>But it was a <em>really</em> great OVA. It&#39;s technically <em>not</em> an OVA, I guess? It exists outside of the Tatami Galaxy spectrum, but just in the right amount: it borrows the visual language and accoutrement of TTG without making it either a rehash or an epilogue.</p>
<p>It was fun to watch, and delightful, and having seen the anime didn&#39;t feel like a &quot;prerequisite&quot; but like an added bonus. </p>

<p>I like bad movies whose goal is to be entertaining and they succeed at it; I hate good movies whose goal is to elevate and they fail at it. Or maybe I think the first bucket of movie is good and the second is bad: the goal is to accomplish your goal, truistic as that might be. This is why I think I love bubblegum pop so much: it is worth admiring something that is being itself as much as it can be.</p>
<p>F9 is not a particularly entertaining movie. There are lots of entertaining moments, but it seems so much more interested in spectacle than entertainment. There are nice things about it — a cozy and understated multiculturalism, an implicit understanding of plot armor, John Cena being absolutely fucking ripped — but the movie seemed more interested in playing with magnets than actually entertaining me.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>This was not a great movie, but it had one transcendent piece and one very nice piece that elevated it a bit in my mind:</p>
<ol>
<li>A depiction of a Second Life-esque universe that was legitimately awesome both in terms of aesthetics and creativity, complete with the kind of creative character design that I would associate with something closer to a JRPG. </li>
<li>A very, very sweet (and Persona-esque) deus ex machina moment that served as the very anime climax to the movie.</li>
</ol>
<p>I don&#39;t think I&#39;d handily recommend it to folks, but those parts were fun and inventive that it&#39;s worth a positive score.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>The piece of work that this reminded me <em>most</em> of was [[Friends From College]], which recency bias aside makes a lot of sense — both are pieces that are centrally interested in how raw and bizarre close college friendships can be <em>and</em> how quickly toxic and deleterious they become after graduation (obvious the show is talking about a timescale of decades, whereas <em>St. Elmo’s Fire</em> is only really interested in a year or two’s distance). I think this film does hit on some core emotional truths: the melodrama &amp; the frankness-bordering-on-after-school-special felt <em>correct</em> to me. Unfortunately, the movies foibles are, uh, painful: the “Emilio Estevez turns into a stalker” storyline went from something that I could charitably refer to as parodic/resonant into Purely Weird AnD Bad super quickly; Rob Lowe’s character was only granted growth and serenity offscreen. I did not like these characters: I knew them, but I did not want to spend time with them, and I don’t think I would have liked them any more if I spent any more time with them.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>I loved it! It was warm and sweet and gorgeous and there was nothing not to enjoy about it. The voice cast was solid, I loved all of the characters (even the miserly grandma throw-in who of course redeemed herself.)

            <description><![CDATA[<p>It was cute and nice but felt straight-up like a three-episode epilogue of the main series. In contrast, the Cowboy Bebop movie felt like more of a <em>distillation</em> of what the show was about into a tighter movie with a stronger budget. Maybe I am just not super into the concept of OVAs; less of an issue with this as a movie and more about my expectations of it.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>This was a very well executed show. Great acting, direction, and cinematography. The plotline was predictable and each little twist and turn felt a trifle on the cheesy side, but I didn’t mind that much — I think it lowered the ceiling of the show to have the developments be as rote as they were, but it was still gripping and thrilling. I particularly enjoyed the warmth and humanity that the show gave to the bit roles: the druggist, the lovelorn former rival, etc. </p>
<p>(Oh, but the ceiling chess is dumb as hell.)</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Early-era Grant and Hepburn: charming(ly obvious) plot, dynamite script, 97 minute runtime. I don’t know what’s not to love. It is not as obviously wonderful as Bringing Up Baby (which is still, I think, the funniest in the era) or The Philadelphia Story but I think it’s carried equally by the strength of the supporting cast.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>I don’t think this movie <em>quite</em> succeeded at threading the line between satire and comedy-of-errors; the points where it wavered into what felt like gravitas (in particular the final act) felt like missteps.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Good things about this movie:</p>
<ol>
<li>The Gadot-Pine chemistry is a lone bright spot in the vanilla hellscape of superhero romance.</li>
<li>The “hey, we’re in 1984!” stuff was fun and silly (until they dropped it for no real reason in the second act.)</li>
<li>Wiig was not bad!</li>
</ol>
<p>Bad things about this movie:</p>
<ol>
<li>The plot doesn’t make sense. Why does Lord require more wishes? Because it makes him more powerful? But it was also killing him? Why doesn’t he just wish for immortality or whatever? Why is he trying to get more shit at all?</li>
<li>“I’m touching them through particles!” Come on that it just the dumbest shit ever.</li>
<li>The effects were particularly bad this go-round. Lasso-of-Truth-ing a lightning bolt was a nadir.</li>
<li>TWO AND A HALF HOURS OF RUNTIME.</li>
<li>The movie doesn’t even stop to examine the fairly intriguing premise of what happened to Not Chris Pine’s soul while Chris Pine was inhabiting NCP’s body!</li>
<li>As mentioned above, the movie decided 1984 wasn’t interesting starting in the second act and so we had to settle for very boring set pieces.</li>
</ol>
<p>I don’t know. I think you need <em>something</em> memorable and good to elevate a superhero movie into something bigger, and I grade on a curve! I thought Thor: Ragnarok was delightful because it leaned into its triviality. But this movie has nothing going for it, and lacked the pathos of its predecessor. Oof.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>You can say whatever you want about this movie. You can say the plot is nonsensical, that every line is twice as maudlin as it needs to be, and any character that isn&#39;t Stewart&#39;s is a pastiche that makes A Christmas Carol look modern and nuanced. You can make fun of Jimmy Stewart&#39;s delivery as much as you want. You — and everyone&#39;s — criticisms are valid and fair.</p>
<p>But man, if you don&#39;t tear up during Auld Lang Syne, I will probably call you a liar. I remember the first time this movie made me cry — 2012 — and it&#39;s made me cry a little more every year since.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>I think this is what a low-stakes, low-investment romantic comedy should be! There are, I guess, suggestions of conflict and stakes — will Cameron Diaz’s character stay in England? will Kate Winslet break free of her manipulative boss? — but you know exactly how every plot line will unfold and resolve within the first ten minutes of the film. The moments of genuine surprise — Jude Law’s character having two children, Dustin Hoffman randomly being in a Blockbuster — are joyous.  All this movie is is a vehicle to let some charming people bounce around each other’s orbit and to make you feel slightly warmer, and it does that very well. </p>
<p>I think the two quibbles I have are:</p>
<ol>
<li>It is one hundred and forty minutes! That is too long for an airy romantic comedy. Cut out thirty minutes of the fluff (though I suppose one would argue that it’s <em>all</em> fluff) and it’s a much leaner enterprise.</li>
<li>The movie suggests at some clever meta-commentary on romantic comedies, between the WGA playing a role and the (fairly well-done!) non-diegetic movie trailer shenanigans. It could have leaned into this like three degrees more and still gotten some mileage, I think.</li>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>If there’s ever a movie that seems unfair to judge on its own terms its this one. <em>Part 1</em> was tough to judge on its own terms because it existed purely as table-setting for this, but in many ways this <em>entire movie</em> is only legible to those who are well versed in the universe: and not just the universe of the movies, but the universe of the books. (This is one of those statements that seems impossible to contradict; I am sure there are people who have only seen the movies and they enjoyed this one, but I don’t know of any.)</p>
<p>So if the movie’s goal was to transmute a thrilling and satisfying ending to the books onto the screen, I think it did a really good job. The climactic battle was thrilling and wondrous; some of the manic set pieces, like the Gringotts’ heist, felt the appropriate mix of fun and dangerous. And, true to the book’s form, the epilogue sucked. It’s well acted, well directed, and well scored.</p>
<p>I don’t know what to say, then! It’s a movie you’ll enjoy if you’ll enjoy it. I had a good time. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If there’s ever a movie that seems unfair to judge on its own terms its this one. <em>Part 1</em> was tough to judge on its own terms because it existed purely as table-setting for this, but in many ways this <em>entire movie</em> is only legible to those who are well versed in the universe: and not just the universe of the movies, but the universe of the books. (This is one of those statements that seems impossible to contradict; I am sure there are people who have only seen the movies and they enjoyed this one, but I don’t know of any.)</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>My understanding was that this was the ur-romcom in a lot of ways, and it felt like that! The chemistry between the leads was great — and not great in a “great for its time” way. I thought the framing of the entire movie through the Greyhound bus was fun, and it’s hard not to see the threads of this movie (upstairs woman, downstairs rogue) show up in so many of its successors (His Girl Friday! Roman Holiday!) while having that basic structure not cheapen or dullen it in any way. I don’t think there’s anything, like, exclamatory about the film — I wouldn’t peg it for a five-Academy-Award winner — but it was good and fun and easy to recommend.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>It&#39;s interesting the extent to which this movie feels divorced from the ones preceding it &quot;Hogwarts is the best and most important character&quot; might be a stale take but it&#39;s a true one, and while the cinematography of this film (the camp-outs are truly gorgeous!) tries to make up for the lack of turrets and parapets it feels impossible. Everyone is grimy and nobody is wearing robes: besides a few warm and entertaining scenes the film is straight up morose and Serious (which doesn&#39;t bother me quite as much as the Order of the Phoenix&#39;s lack of levity, because here at least it makes sense.)</p>
<p>It&#39;s worth saying that this fails utterly as a stand-alone movie. There is no true climax or denouement; it ends on a bummer and the entire thing <em>feels</em> like the prologue that it truly is. But it still isn&#39;t bad!</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Okay, now this is what a fantasy movie should be. Absolutely gorgeous effects &amp; cinematography (a marked improvement from the drab darkness and excessively cool tones of Order of the Phoenix), a script with a bunch of levity (the first and I think only Harry Potter movie that legitimately made me laugh more than once!), and a climax that, sure, is overwrought, but looks cool and seems <em>important</em> in the overall narrative.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>What a joyless two hours. Some notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>An important test for a fiction is: does it imbue its villains and obstacles with any redeeming or interesting characteristics whatsoever? (The answer here, of course, is no.)</li>
<li>Helena Bonham Carter appears to be the only person in this movie who knows that it is a fantasy film and that it is okay to emote.</li>
<li>Nothing happens! There is so much angst and nothing interesting or useful happens that isn&#39;t a death! Who gives a shit about the prophecy!</li>
<li>Okay, the final wizarding duel is pretty fun, and a marked step up from the tug-of-war climax of the fourth movie.</li>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>A very good low-stakes rom-com. There were just a lot of things I liked:</p>
<ul>
<li>The return of Tony Randall, who was delightful (and perfectly weaselly) in <em>Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter?</em> and even more so here.</li>
<li>A <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-BG1URUTI0">very charming opening credits</a></li>
<li>Incredible early-sixties set design and costume design</li>
<li>A very fun and of-its-time framing device (I was completely unaware of the concept of a &quot;party line&quot;!)</li>
<li>A generally winsome and tweak-y script and direction which made up for the lack of chemistry between the two leads.</li>
</ul>
<p>And the only thing I think I disliked is the complete lack of climax/denouement — the last ten minutes seemed to melt away without conflict or actual resolution besides &quot;well, they&#39;re together now!&quot;</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Just a really, really solid slapstick. Cary Grant is incredible (reading on Wikipedia this was the impetus for his launch into superstardom, which is totally earned); Irene Dunne, who is not my favorite, puts up a superlative back half (her scene as &quot;Lola&quot; is perhaps the best in the entire film.) The movie feels loose and improv-y in a way that few movies of its era do; there are a few bits that age it (my mind is drawn to the very cute and very advanced-for-its-time special effect with the cuckoo clock) but you could do a shot-for-shot remake of this and it&#39;d be well-received.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>You know, the conventional wisdom is that the Craig Bond movies have been in a tick-tock nature: <em>Casino Royale</em> is glorious, but <em>Quantum</em> is bad; <em>Skyfall</em> is glorious, and then <em>Spectre</em> suffers.</p>
<p>And this is true to an extent. Watching this for the first time, after having watched <em>Casino Royale</em> the night prior, highlighted its flaws in sharp relief. The cast is universally less interesting (with the exception of Fields, who I thought played her role superbly); the script is more muddled; the set pieces comically unrealistic.</p>
<p>But it also compared favorably in a few respects! The pacing of the film is, on the whole, better (it helps that it&#39;s forty minutes leaner!); the climactic showdown in the erstwhile hotel, while grandoise in true Bond fashion, was dramatic in a way that I don&#39;t think Casino Royale ever hit. And the general theme of the movie — Bond as an out-of-control widower — works having freshly seen the denoument of the previous film.</p>
<p>It&#39;s not, like, a <em>good</em> film. But it is unfairly maligned, and fine by popcorn standards.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>I rewatched this having watched it once a long time ago; I remembered liking it quite a bit, and I still do, though perhaps my patience/illusionment with Bond films has waned quite a bit. The cast is great and the setting &amp; plot is superb, but I couldn&#39;t help having two ornery thoughts, somewhat commingled:</p>
<ul>
<li>How is this thing <em>two and a half hours long</em>?</li>
<li>Why do the action sequences need to be <em>this long</em>?</li>
</ul>
<p>There&#39;s probably a taut, superior version of this movie that clocks in at a hundred minutes. But it&#39;s still the most vivid realization of what Bond movies are or can be (barring Skyfall&#39;s slightly meta turn).</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>I came in with high hopes: I like Allen&#39;s ouevre and this was supposed to be one of his best.</p>
<p>And there were parts that I really liked: I thought Allen&#39;s self-insert narrative was sort of silly and sweet, I thought the dynamic between the three sisters was vivid and real, and I thought the thesis of the film — the titular Hannah being the person to whom we&#39;re afforded the least interiority despite her having a lion&#39;s share of grief — was clever and interesting and, given a generous eye, an interesting inversion of the &quot;model sitcom mom&quot; trope so prevalent in the eighties. (Ah, and the music was good.)</p>
<p>But — and maybe it is unfair to say this, to view this film through a 2020 lens — parts of it were just gross! I can ignore the foreshadowing of Allen writing about a man who leaves his wife for a family member, sure, but everything Michael Caine touched in this movie felt despicable. I am okay with him portraying a flawed husband, but his chemistry with every single other character feels pained and alien, and his perspective affords no sympathy.</p>
<p>If I wanted a vaguely misogynist and beautiful film, I&#39;d watch Midnight in Paris; if I wanted something sweet and a little mournful, I&#39;d rewatch Radio Days. I have no desire to re-mine this movie.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Incredibly good if not revelatory. Heston and Welles (and even Leigh!) were all amazing. The script was great and the core plot was tight (even if the script wasn’t a world-beater.) The opening shot is just as great as all of the direction following it. My only complaint, such as it is, is that I think the best noirs have to leave you with a little bit of emptiness or melancholy: they have to shake your belief a bit. The ‘twist’ ending (Welles’ hunch was right!) was a bit of this, but...I dunno. Not quite enough.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>I am maybe being too harsh on this movie with its rating: if I watched it divorced of context, I would surely raise it higher. But, viewed in light of the series, it feels so devoid of so many of the sources of its greatness: interplay between the cast (Jet and Faye are all but absent), a coherent and timeless soundtrack, well-tuned pacing.</p>
<p>There are unquestionably good bits here: the animation and direction are wonderful and unambiguously improved, the Moroccan aesthetic is lovely, and the story of Vincent &amp; Elektra feel very much &quot;in the vein&quot; of the melancholy themes of the show. But elevating this story into a film feels unfair: it would have been better as a two-parter.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>I think my partner and I called this wholesome at least seven times over the course of the film. It was so good! I love Kiki; I love Jiji; I love the cast of characters whom are all universally warm and kind-hearted.

<p>It’s tempting to compare this to <a href="/content/my-neighbor-totoro">Totoro</a>, given that I watched it for the first time so recently as well.  <em>Totoro</em> definitely hit me harder, and I think the purity and moral at the center of it is more potent; but unlike, say, the Pixar canon, it’s not that Kiki was a slightly lesser version — it had a completely different ambition and message.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I think my partner and I called this wholesome at least seven times over the course of the film. It was so good!

I love flying as a motif, and even though the true arc of the movie (Kiki’s self-assuredness) came to a natural end I could have spent an entire series watching Kiki bop around this lovely world.</p>

<p>And yet, feels regressive compared to, say, Bringing Up Baby (maybe I&#39;m biased from having spent July watch Grant / Hepburn vehicles?) despite coming out fifteen years latter. Peck doesn&#39;t play lighthearted well, and Hepburn is obviously luminous but there isn&#39;t a tremendous amount of moment-to-moment chemistry (again, excepting those final scenes.)</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Objectively a fun, good movie. (I don’t know about “best romantic comedy of all time” — When Harry Met Sally still holds that crown in my opinion — but it’s up there.) The Grant-Hepburn-Stewart trifecta was great, though I was surprised to learn that this was late in the Grant-Hepburn partnership (their chemistry felt off, especially having watched Bringing Up Baby so recently); Hepburn and Hussey were honestly the standout performances, and the script was just the right blend of screwball and sly.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Probably can be viewed in retrospect as a bit of a pivot point for Adam McKay going from “dumb comedies” to “smart dumb comedies”, right? I watched this for the first time knowing the shtick and was genuinely entertained (we wanted, explicitly, a “fun dumb movie” after a few rounds of drinks.) There are a couple strokes of genius (the runner about TLC, for instance); the third act runs out of steam, as parodies tend to do. Overall, can’t really complain about what this movie was trying to do and it more or less succeeding at it.</p>
