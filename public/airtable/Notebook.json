The Vietnam Memorial in Washington, D.C., is surely one of the most successful war memorials ever built, if one is to judge by the quantity and intensity of the visits it receives. Designed by Maya Lin, the memorial consists simply of a gently undulating site marked (not dominated) by a long, low, black marble wall listing the names of the fallen. The names are listed neither alphabetically nor by military unit but chronologically, in the order in which they fell—thus grouping those who had fallen on the same day in the same engagement.[895] No larger claim is made about the war either in prose or in sculpture—which is hardly surprising, in view of the stark political cleavages the war still inspires.[896] What is most remarkable, however, is the way that the Vietnam Memorial works for those who visit it, particularly those who come to pay their respects to the memory of a comrade or loved one. They touch the names incised on the wall, make rubbings, and leave artifacts and mementos of their own—everything from poems and a woman’s highheeled shoe to a glass of champagne and a poker hand of a full house, aces high. So many of these tributes have been left, in fact, that a museum has been created to house them. The scene of many people together at the wall, touching the names of particular loved ones who fell in the same war, has moved observers regardless of their position on the war itself. I believe that a great part of the memorial’s symbolic power is its capacity to honor the dead with an openness that allows visitors to impress upon it their own meanings, their own histories, their own memories. The memorial virtually requires participation in order to complete its meaning.

Moving in its own right, referring as it does to the final moment of a victory gained at an enormous cost in lives, the Iwo Jima statue is manifestly heroic. Its patriotism (symbolized by the flag), its reference to conquest, its larger-than-life scale, and its implicit theme of unity in victory leave little room for wondering what is expected from the viewer. Given the virtual unanimity with which that war was, and is, viewed in the United States, it is hardly surprising that the Iwo Jima memorial should be monumental and explicit about its message. Although not exactly “canned,” the Iwo Jima site is more symbolically self-sufficient, as are most war memorials. Visitors can stand in awe, gazing on an image that through photographs and sculpture has become a virtual icon for the War in the Pacific, but they receive its message rather than completing it.[897]\n\n"}},"fields":{"Name":55,"Source":["recXcPojySASnULJS"],"Text":"A brief example comparing war memorials may be helpful.

My mother, who was born a Jew in Poland, once told me a joke from her childhood: There was a small town located along the frontier between Russia and Poland; no one was ever quite sure to which it belonged. One day an official treaty was signed and not long after, surveyors arrived to draw a border. Some villagers approached them where they had set up their equipment on a nearby hill. “So where are we, Russia or Poland?” “According to our calculations, your village now begins exactly thirty-seven meters into Poland.” The villagers immediately began dancing for joy. “Why?” the surveyors asked. “What difference does it make?” “Don’t you know what this means?” they replied. “It means we’ll never have to endure another one of those terrible Russian winters!\n\n"}},{"_table":{"_base":{"_airtable":{},"_id":"app5RDJQQni8Itd2D"},"id":null,"name":"Notebook"},"id":"rec7BwYd9t3tVcHNF","_rawJson":{"id":"rec7BwYd9t3tVcHNF","createdTime":"2020-06-09T23:03:02.000Z","fields":{"Name":87,"Source":["reczex9WxTiRA42eC"],"Text":"We know nothing of how it all works, / how we end up in one bed or another, / speak one language instead of the others, / what heat draws us to our life’s work / or keeps us from a dream until it’s nothing / but a blister we scratch in our sleep.\n\n"}},"fields":{"Name":87,"Source":["reczex9WxTiRA42eC"],"Text":"We know nothing of how it all works, / how we end up in one bed or another, / speak one language instead of the others, / what heat draws us to our life’s work / or keeps us from a dream until it’s nothing / but a blister we scratch in our sleep.\n\n"}},{"_table":{"_base":{"_airtable":{},"_id":"app5RDJQQni8Itd2D"},"id":null,"name":"Notebook"},"id":"recFoUc1AmOzB8uD2","_rawJson":{"id":"recFoUc1AmOzB8uD2","createdTime":"2020-06-09T23:03:10.000Z","fields":{"Name":88,"Source":["reczex9WxTiRA42eC"],"Text":"Steal something worthless, something small, / every once in a while.

There’s a photograph of what can only be the pre-dinner floor show: an acrobat in a leotard kneeling on a pedestal, her legs contorted, her feet grasping a bow and arrow, poised to release. Her target is a stuffed heart, printed with the company logo. I scroll past animated photo-booth GIFs of strangers, kissing and mugging for the camera, and I recognize their pride, I empathize with their sense of accomplishment — this was one hell of a year, and they have won. I feel gently ill, a callback to the childhood nausea of being left out."}},{"_table":{"_base":{"_airtable":{},"_id":"app5RDJQQni8Itd2D"},"id":null,"name":"Notebook"},"id":"reckkbNjIoXD9zDGq","_rawJson":{"id":"reckkbNjIoXD9zDGq","createdTime":"2020-06-10T22:38:14.000Z","fields":{"Name":170,"Text":"But how shall we educate men to goodness, to a sense of one another, to a love of the truth?
