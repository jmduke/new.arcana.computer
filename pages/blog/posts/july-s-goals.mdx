I set two streak goals in July:

1. _Drinking less_ [^1]. This one fell a little short but was great overall. I had to tweak my definition of less; I'm not great at refusing a single beer in social situations (such as grabbing dinner with someone on a Thursday), but I ended up cutting my alcohol intake sincerely. This fell apart in the last week of the month because I was traveling, more or less on vacation, and drinking (not a huge amount — one to two drinks) every night. Still, good! I'd like to keep this up.
2. _Writing two hundred words every day._ [^2]_. This one went...poorly. I didn't even count for the back half of the month, which is never a good sign. I think this is more of a meta thing: just like last month, I'm bad at these creative or output-focused tasks because they always seem to fall off of my todo list and so I only notice them at the end of the night as I'm wrapping things up.

August's goals (now that I'm exactly one day into the month) are going to be twofold:

1. **Clear out my inbox every morning before starting work**. This is going to be a tough one, I'm not going to lie — I'm really bad at this historically. I also think if I get good at this it will be *hugely* beneficial to my mental state, which is why I'm excited about it.
2. **Write two hundred words every day**. That's right, I'm back at this again — I am so disappointed with how last month went I want another crack at it (starting, of course, with this very post!) I'm going to keep myself a little more honest by keeping a log of what I've written.

[^1]: Less meaning "zero drinks on weekdays, two drinks on weekends."

[^2]: Public meaning "published to the internet". Blog posts count; snippets count; documentation counts; internal memos do not count.
