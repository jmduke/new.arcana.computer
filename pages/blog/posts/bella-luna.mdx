Two important facts:

1. We're getting married in a scant four months at a venue whose name is "Bella Luna Farms";
2. I managed to score a bottle of Fiorente, a sort of off-brand St. Germaine, for $12 thanks to ABC running a liquidation sale.

And so it was fate, when I wanted to break open the bottle with a test run for some sort of gin cocktail, that [cocktail virgin/slut](https://cocktailvirgin.blogspot.com/2021/10/bella-luna.html)
had a perfectly-named cocktail for the occasion.

The author's comparison to an Aviation is apt; with the barspoon of simple omitted, it's essentially an exercise in substituting maraschino for elderflower.

Thankfully, we _like_ Aviations, though this does not help much the core problem (because we also tend to let our maraschino linger). A nice, springtime aperitif; probably not going into the rotation,
but at the very least I know I can batch this for a soiree and not be disappointed.
