I recently came across [Mela](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mela-recipe-manager/id1548466041) on the App Store.

It is a delightful app. Nothing clever or fussy — just the underlying architecture of an RSS reader / HTML prettifier niched down to the world of recipe management.

It is a *very clever* app for that exact reason. The developer is also behind [Reeder](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/reeder-5/id1529445840), a well-known RSS application and it is fairly obvious from comparing the two that they share a lot of DNA, both in terms of UI and underlying architecture.

I am envious of this! This is a smart way of extending yourself far as an independent developer: build something, find what else can be built (and marketed) using what you've already built. (I'm not suggesting that Mela is *literally* part of the Reeder codebase, but that doesn't matter — the tacit knowledge you get transfers just as easily as library code, and in some cases even *more* easily.)
