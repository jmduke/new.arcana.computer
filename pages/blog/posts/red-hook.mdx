Haley requested a whiskey cocktail that broke from the old-fashioned mold to which we are
so frequently lured, and I found myself drawn to the [Red Hook](https://tuxedono2.com/red-hook-cocktail-recipe)
as outlined by the inimitable Tuxedo no. 2. They warn:

> While it is difficult to find anything wrong with this drink, itâ€™s greatest asset is also its potential downside: what makes it so palatable could possibly be perceived as boring

How right they are! We made this with Bulleit, Cocchi, and Luxardo; it tasted like, well, a slightly
more floral Manhattan. We both instantly settled on a seven-out-of-ten rating, which is not too bad (and
frankly a good use of Luxardo, which I find myself sitting on a lot unless I'm in the mood for an Aviation.)
