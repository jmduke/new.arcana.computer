[Sumana](https://www.changeset.nyc/) recommended a [podcast episode on caffeine](https://play.acast.com/s/saywhytodrugs/caffeine). It's a short episode, and it's good, and I recommend you listen to it. It focuses a lot on the "huh, it's weird that we've all agreed as a society that stimulant addiction in this one specific instance is okay!" of it all — which I don't mean in a dismissive way, just that I've encountered it a few times before and most recently in [Michael Pollan's mediocre book on caffeine](https://michaelpollan.com/books/caffeine-how-coffee-and-tea-created-the-modern-world/).

The thing that stuck with me the most about the episode was an amateur science experiment: a researcher ordered the same latte at the same coffee shop five or so times and discovered _wildly_ different results.  One day you might get 125mg of caffeine; the next, you might end up with _double_ that amount.

This strikes me as deeply metaphorical for _something_ — it's very easy, and very tempting, to mentally commoditize things that are in fact completely variable depending on a long tail of exogenous (or otherwise hidden) factors.
