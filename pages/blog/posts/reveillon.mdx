I found this from the terrific [Tuxedo no. 2](https://tuxedono2.com/reveillon-cocktail-recipe)
(which is, pound for pound, one of the greatest sites on the internet: beautiful, effective, and delightful).

This drink _should_ be up my alley. Perhaps I need to improve the quality of pear brandy used; it certainly wasn't _bad_,
but tasted like it was missing a dimension. I could imagine that it could be improved with something that gives a bit of a body
and a slightly sweet note: a barspoon of rich demerara, maybe? It is something I definitely want to tinker with further,
but for the moment it's more of an oddity than something I want to keep remaking for enjoyments' sake.
