I love my bottle of Mr. Black, but I haven't _done_ much with it (besides use it for many, many espresso martinis.) Wanting to stretch my horizon a little, I googled around and finally landed on their official site where they offer a few hackneyed twists. This felt like the easiest â€” half rye, half Mr. Black, bitters and stir.

Haley did _not_ like it. I found it... pretty delightful! I can't say I'll necessarily make it over an espresso martini, but it certainly worked. The subtle sweetness of the Mr. Black works as an _in absentia_ syrup, and you're left with a heavy coffee-forward sipper. It is not a complex or sophisticated drink, but it tastes more substantial than the novelty that the title might suggest.
