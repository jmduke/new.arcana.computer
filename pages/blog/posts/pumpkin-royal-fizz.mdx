The Aviary's series of cocktail books tend to be a bit more aspirational
than practical for me at this point in my life; they are a good jumping-off
point for interesting recipe ideas and techniques, but I don't have the
equipment or ingredients to make many of them. (I'm in a phase where I want
to make things that are mostly three-or-four ingredient riffs.)

Their holiday cocktail book is a little more practical, though, and contained a 'pumpkin royal
fizz' that only required two fairly esoteric bottles: the Rhum Clement Creole Shrubb Liqueur D'Orange [^1]
and the Ancho Reyes Verde. I wanted to get the latter anyway, so I shopped online for the former.

This drink is really a two-parter: a 'pumpkin stock base' which combines pumpkin puree, maple syrup,
the aforementioned liqueurs, plus spices and bourbon, and then the royal fizz (the base, a whole egg,
heavy cream, and soda). The idea is you make the base as a batch and then build the fizzes as needed.

We were, frankly, not super impressed with the fizz. It wasn't _bad_, but it felt a little like a drink
for people who didn't want a drink: somehow both rich and thin and certainly _quaffable_, but not particularly
rewarding for all the effort.

We loved the base, though, and tinkered with it a bit to end up with a drink that we both really enjoyed.

We ended up turning it into a pumpkin flip:

- 3 oz pumpkin stock base (as defined by the Aviary)
- 1 oz bourbon
- 1 whole egg
- 1/2 oz almond milk [^2]

This was _delicious_. An exquisite mouthfeel with a nice, rich, pumpkin flavor whose body
is bolstered by the extra slug of bourbon. A good substitute for egg-nog, for those who
are less nog-inclined for whatever reason.

[^1]: In retrospect, this could have been easily subbed with a dry curacao.
[^2]: Haley is not a dairy-friendly individual; I'd probably sub in a barspoon of heavy cream here.
