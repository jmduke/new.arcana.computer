Continuing our weekday tradition of a tiki wind-down, we made [Old Port Painkillers](http://cocktailvirgin.blogspot.com/2020/09/oppk-old-port-painkiller.html) last night.

We...were underwhelmed. I think the beauty of painkillers is in the use of coconut creme, which gives it a bit of thickness and novelty that this iteration wholly lacks. It was basically... rummy muddled orange juice. Do not recommend!
