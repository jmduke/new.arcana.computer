Haley has grown fond recently of calling my kitchen habits "my experiments". She is not entirely incorrect: I've started binging through [Kevin Kos's excellent channel on cocktails](https://www.youtube.com/c/cocktailtimewithkevinkos) and following along with some of the prep work. The irony of this being that we're actually cutting back our drinking pretty heavily — it is cutting season, after all — so there's more time spent preparing the ingredients than enjoying them.

Anyhoo. Kevin Kos suggested homemade orgeat, and orgeat is one of the few things that I haven't found a bottle of that I'm particularly satisfied by, and it seemed pretty easy with a handful of niche but non-perishable ingredients (gum arabic, xanthan gum, et cetera), so I figured I should make some orgeat.

And then I had a bottle of orgeat, and some lime juice that we need to use before we go out of town for a week, and a Mai Tai sort of just fell into my lap. I was not actually sure what the recipe for a Mai Tai *is*, and the internet (as is often the case with tiki drinks) disagreed vehemently with itself. I adapted my recipe from [Liquor.com](https://www.liquor.com/recipes/traditional-mai-tai/)'s, going with:

- 1.5 oz amber rum
- 1 oz dark rum
- 0.75 oz orgeat
- 0.75 oz lime juice
- 0.75 oz curaçao

Typing that out really makes you realize how much of a punch it packs, I suppose. The thing tastes dangerous; I was tempted to make a version of it subbing orgeat with simple just to taste the difference but I don't think I could handle a second Mai Tai. (Once Haley gets back, we'll do a taste test.)

Anyway, I love Mai Tais. I don't love them as much as I think I love the Hurricane lineage of tiki drinks — there is something pure about the emphasis on bright juices that appeals to me more — but I'm excited to batch these for a coming cookout.
