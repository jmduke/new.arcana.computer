A first: to find a cocktail on [cocktail slut](https://cocktailvirgin.blogspot.com/2023/01/pop-gun.html)
that is not just "not my style" but downright undrinkable. I suspect this is because rather than using Kahlua
I used Mr. Black (which is a _delightful_ coffee liqueur, but certainly lacks the...sugary aura of Kahlua)
leaving the original cut of this drink heavy and leaden. Mixing in two barspoons of demerara helped matters,
and let the peat and coffee notes shine a little bit more through the mud, but this will not be a drink
that we revisit even on an infinite timespan. (Which means it's time to find _other_ ways to use this Calvados!)
