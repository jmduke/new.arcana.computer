Haley requested a gin drink; I am nothing if not a judger of books by their covers,
and the one-two punch of the [Poet's Dream](https://tuxedono2.com/poet-s-dream-cocktail-recipe)'s name
and hue seemed too intriguing to pass up.

The drink is simple: a perfect martini with an equal portion of Benedictine. The result was delightful;
the Benedictine dominates the drink as much as you might expect, but the gin saves it from being saccharine
and the vermouth saves it from being too potent. (Next time, I'd like to double-express the lemon peel to give
it a bit more citrus.)
