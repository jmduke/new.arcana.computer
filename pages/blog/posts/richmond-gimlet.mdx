*My god.* I found [this recipe](https://jeffreymorgenthaler.com/the-richmond-gimlet/) from a list of [Jeffrey Morganthaler’s absolute favorites](https://jeffreymorgenthaler.com/my-top-ten-favorite-drinks/) and… I get why. I am not a big fan of traditional gimlets: I would rather have a margarita if I want something lime forward or a martini if I want something gin forward. The cutback of citrus here and the inclusion of mint makes this something unto itself: a simple, refreshing, sweet-but-not-too-sweet spring and summer staple. Haley and I are both in love, and have a feeling we’re going to be crushing a great many more of these before the summer is over.

(Alas, the Richmond in its name is not a reference to my city, but still — it counts as at least half a point's worth of serendipity.)
