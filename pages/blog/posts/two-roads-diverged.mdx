The drink of the season has arrived, [courtesy of Frederic Yarm](http://cocktailvirgin.blogspot.com/2022/10/two-roads-diverged.html). We have not been able to keep this in our glasses long enough to take any aesthetic thirst traps of it, but it is very much the "fall in a glass" it set out to be: an apple brandy base with maple, benedictine, cinnamon, and lemon to round it out and give it all the spice and warmth you'd expect from such a moniker. 

Most of our mainstay autumn-y cocktails rely on allspice dram, which has been nigh-impossible to snag in Virginia (thanks, state-regulated alcohol monopoly!) and this serves not just as an adequate replacement but as a worthy contender for Best Autumn Drink. I am particularly excited about how easy this should be to batch; a bottle of it seems a welcome addition to any sort of Thanksgiving get-together.
