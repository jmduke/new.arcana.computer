It was a long night filled with mortgage application shenanigans, and Haley and I thought it would be an expeditious opportunity to unwind with something new. We're also in a bottle-buying-freeze at the moment so we can wind down our existing cabinet in preparation for a cross-country trip, which has made trying new things a fun but somewhat challenging enterprise.

Enter the [Dawn of Hospitality](http://cocktailvirgin.blogspot.com/2021/11/dawn-of-hospitality.html), which Frederic describes as a "tropical-inspired Sazerac" and struck us more as: well, we didn't know _what_ to think of it before trying it, but a cocktailed version of a cold brew tonic came to mind. (Note: we used passionfruit syrup rather than pineapple, since we had some left over from Hurricane season.)

The result was...somewhat underwhelming, honestly, but certainly not _bad_. The fruity flavors mostly got washed out in the rye, and it ended up tasting more like a coffee-forward old fashioned with a little less bite than normal. I don't think we would make it again, but it did open me up to the possibility of using our espresso liqueur mostly as a wash for rye & whiskey.
