Tonight’s [cocktail of choice](http://cocktailvirgin.blogspot.com/2018/06/tropical-champagne.html), courtesy of cocktail virgin. There is a certain class of cocktail that is best described as “base plus plus”; a french 75 is champagne plus plus, the Southern 75 is beer plus plus, and this is of course a mimosa plus plus. Anything with passionfruit syrup in it is delightful inherently; the crispness of the champagne offsets it nicely.

Also, as a reminder: the _one product I recommend without recommendation_ is [Aunty Lillikoi’s passionfruit syrup](https://www.auntylilikoi.com). After finishing this sentence I am going back to the store and ordering three more jars.
