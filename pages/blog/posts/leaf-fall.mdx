From [cocktail virgin/slut](https://cocktailvirgin.blogspot.com/2022/10/leaf-fall.html). A rare miss from them;
maybe it's just my palate, but I think you needed _something_ to brighten up all the bitter, autumnal flavors. We
tried a second batch with a barspoon of maple syrup and that helped, but still felt inferior to the [two roads diverged](https://cocktailvirgin.blogspot.com/2022/10/two-roads-diverged.html)
that similarly showcases apple brandy offset by benedictine.
