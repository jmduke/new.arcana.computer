This week in Richmond has been a return to the bizarre schizophrenia of East Coast winters: twenty
degrees in the morning, sixty in the evening. I walk Telly at seven in the morning dressed in four layers
and then find myself wanting a nice refresher at the end of the day, rather than some sort of heavy old fashioned
or Manhattan riff.

I stood downstairs in my bar room, browsing my bottle collection and working backwards from dry curacao. I
landed on the [Royal Bermuda Yacht Club](https://tuxedono2.com/royal-bermuda-yacht-club-cocktail-recipe),
which splits the difference between a daiquiri and something more traditionally tiki. I love tiki drinks but
have been trending away from the saccharine; this seemed intriguing enough to try.

Gang: I was gobsmacked. This is probably my favorite drink I've made since the Rooister Old Fashioned (which,
having typed that, reminds me that I need to write it up!). The taste is unquestionably _tiki_, but stripped
down to its skeleton: I used Smith & Cross as the base rum here which gave it a strong backbone to fight off
the falernum.

I'm very excited to play with this framework some more. (It also seems _incredibly_ well-lent to batching, come
springtime.)
