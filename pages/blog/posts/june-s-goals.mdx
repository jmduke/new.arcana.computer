I set two streak goals in June:

1. _Close all of my rings_. This one was uneventful and easy: I was already pretty good about it, and making a goal out of it made it even more so. 30 for 30, baby!
2. _Game for at least thirty minutes on something non-trivial [^1]_. This one went...poorly. I got 20 days of out 30, having missed almost all of the penultimate week in June and a scattershot of days before then. The penultimate week was because of on-call, but really what bums me out is the scattershot weeks: I didn't make it enough of a discipline, and it just fell out of the world at the end of the night.

July's goals are going to be in a similar vein (one for health, one for mind): writing two hundred public [^2] words every day and drinking less [^3].

[^1]: "Non-trivial" is perhaps a bit idiosyncratic, and I mean it to exclude games that don't "complete" in a useful way (Rocket League, Basketball GM, etc. â€” the sort of empty calorie games that are more of a way for me to turn my brain off than to do anything useful with it.)

[^2]: Public meaning "published to the internet". Blog posts count; snippets count; documentation counts; internal memos do not count.

[^3]: Less meaning "zero drinks on weekdays, two drinks on weekends."
