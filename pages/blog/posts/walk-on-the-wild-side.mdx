The question that [this cocktail](http://cocktailvirgin.blogspot.com/2021/07/walk-on-wild-side.html) poses is “What if you add Amaro Nonino to a Martini?”

The answer is… I think pretty much what you’d expect, which is a slightly spicier and herbal version of the martini. You don’t lose the nonino in the gin (I used Hendrick’s, so it might vary with something more opinionated) but it’s definitely more of a subtle shade than anything else. Haley was a huge fan — she claimed she liked it more than traditional martinis, which is a big statement for her. I was a *fan*, but I don’t think I preferred it to the martini which I like chiefly for its simplicity and purity. This felt like a nice novelty that I’d rather have split up into a martini and an amaro sidecar.
