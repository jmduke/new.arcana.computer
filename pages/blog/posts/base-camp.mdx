In an effort to drain my remaining bottle of creme de cacao, I found the [Base Camp](http://cocktailvirgin.blogspot.com/2020/11/base-camp.html). This seemed like a more complex version of a drink that H & I are quite fond of â€” an unimaginatively named "autumn old fashioned", which is roughly one part allspice dram to two parts rye (with a barspoon of simple). 

The passing similarity was apt; this was a really fun cocktail, though our use of Laphroaig might have required a bit of downscaling (the smokiness overwhelmed some of the other notes, and we could probably downscale to just a quarter of an ounce). I suspect that it would have also benefited from Tempus Fugit rather than our bottom-shelf creme de cacao, but we liked it enough to likely go back again for seconds down the road.
