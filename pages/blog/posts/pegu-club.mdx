Was looking for something spring-y and light for a Wednesday evening wind-down and came across the [Pegu Club](https://tuxedono2.com/the-pegu-club-cocktail-recipe) on
the inimitable [Tuxedo No. 2](https://tuxedono2.com/) blog.

With all respect to the esteemed authors, this recipe led us a fair bit astray: using Pierre Ferrand (and Bombay) turned this drink into an absolute punch of citrus with nary
a hint of sweetness to rescue it. In retrospect, we absolutely should have used Cointreau (instead, we tossed in a barspoon of vanilla simple which helped cut through the lime a bit). Likely
will not make this again: the tricky part about splitting the difference between a daiquiri and a gimlet is, well, wouldn't you just rather have a daiquiri or a gimlet?
