We had [this cocktail](http://cocktailvirgin.blogspot.com/2021/02/erika-marie.html) last night as part of a journey to start burning down some of our lesser-used bottles. I started out trying to find something with spiced pear liqueur and ended up empty, but this caught my eye — we had a couple onces of both Aperol and St. Germaine left. 

It’s really, really good!  Much brighter than I expected (which I think is more on me than the drink — of course something with that much lime and elderflower is going to be light). You don’t get a huge amount of the Aperol’s bitterness: it and the agave work mostly in the background to balance things out. Really fun and would (will!) make again.
