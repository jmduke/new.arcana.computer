Matt and I started off by talking about staging servers/meshes and whether or not they're useful and worth the effort (as you might guess from the name of this podcast, my answer is a resounding "no") but then our conversation took some twists and turns and morphed into an internecine rant against Facebook unfairly and unhelpfully crystalizing all "best practices" in 2010. This one was a lot of fun!
