# Investments

I like to invest in companies that fit the three following criteria:

1. B2B tooling
2. post-revenue but not necessarily at product-market fit
3. not based in the San Francisco Bay Area

My preferred check size is $10,000â€”$25,000 and I am most helpful advising
on monetization strategy & scaling engineering processes.

I've invested in:

- [Arrows](https://arrows.to/), onboarding & customer success tooling for Hubspot
- <span class="bg-gray-600 text-gray-600">redacted</span>, tooling for
  automatically generating and managing SDK bindings
- <span class="bg-gray-600 text-gray-600">redacted</span>, tooling for
  localizing Shopify storefronts
- <span class="bg-gray-600 text-gray-600">redacted</span>, tooling for
  monitoring DNS registrations

I do not mind [cold emails](mailto:me@jmduke.com).
