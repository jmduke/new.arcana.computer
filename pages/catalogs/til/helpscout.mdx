I was evaluating HelpScout as a potential first step in a series of many, _many_ steps to onboard a dedicated support engineer for Buttondown, and it turns out that the process of adding custom content to a given conversation (ie the Stripe information, account details, and most recently sent email, that kind of thing) is _remarkably_ easy. I think I am conditioned to assume pain when I think of the intersection of "customer support software" and "loading content remotely onto a separate SaaS", but it's actually tremendously evening: stand up a single route that takes a POST request and returns HTML, and HelpScout takes care of the rest.
