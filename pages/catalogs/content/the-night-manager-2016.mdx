We watched this off of the heels of another (albeit more oblique) homage to le Carré, [[The Ipcress File]],
and it's remarkable where this succeeds and where this fails in comparison. I do not think that neither Hiddleston
nor Laurie did a _terrific_ job in their respective roles, but they were servicable (and certainly the budget — which
must have been astronomical for 2016 BBC standards — was put to good use).

But the sacrifices made to le Carré's original plot in order to make this a little bit more _television-y_ are felt,
especially in the final two episodes. Hiddleston's character acts in a way that is patently absurd, and Laurie's refusal
to just kill him outright is equally daft. The necessity of the showrunners to tie everything up in a neat bow is...
so very American, and feels like a betrayal of the source material.

But!

Sometimes a show can be redeemed by a single scene, and here is what I will remember about _The Night Manager_: four minutes
of Laurie gleefully detonating bombs and dispersing napalm, streaks of red and orange across a pitch black sky. Tremendously
good cinema, beautiful and chilling in equal parts.
