This game is a classic empty calories idle game, except with bits of Minecraft mixed in. Numbers go up, there are tons of things to do, the core gameplay loop feels incredibly addicting until... it doesn't. Some of this is endemic to the genre; some of it is self-inflicted. The Switch port has a number of really serious flaws (load time and slowdown in the late game is horrendous, and I'm someone who isn't really sensitive to such things); crafting time for late-game materials seems intentionally user-hostile, and combat never really evolves into something meaningful or interesting.

All of that is negative, but I can't deny that I played this game ravenously for a solid ten or fifteen hours or so before the disenchantment grew. So if you're looking for a good way to fritter away a week, this fits the bill!
