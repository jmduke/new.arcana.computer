What was the _goal_ of the show? What were we supposed to think about as viewers? This was a thing I struggled with
a lot while watching this half-mockumentary, half-reality-show. I do not think it was quite funny enough to justify its
own existence (and the final episode, a sort of behind-the-scenes feel-good victory lap, made it feel like the real triumph
of the show was the ornate backflips it required to keep the 'contestant' from discovering the ruse), but it had a couple
justifiably terrific moments â€” most of them involving James Marsden, an under-appreciated delight.
