What a delightful show. I did not know where it was taking me; I do not think the show knew where it was going.

I don’t mean that even to be coy, or to avoid spoilers. How do you spoil a show like this? The “plot”, such as it is, is pretty minor — you enjoy it for the things that it is trying to tell you about the process of being an artist and enjoying art, and how those two things transform you. It is funny and odd and bizarre. I’m not sure how to sell someone on it, but this is how I would try:

A bunch of extremely talented actors do weird metafiction stuff.

Again, not a great sell. But I had a very good time with it.
