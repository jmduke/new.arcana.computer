This performance by the [Quill Theatre](https://www.quilltheatre.org) was very cute. Outdoor setting in Agecroft which was food-and-drink friendly; made the whole thing feel like casual dinner theatre. (Next time we're gonna bring a pizza and some prosecco.) 

The play itself was a riot and a farce, with a script that, like all Shakespeare these days, impresses me with its wit and agility. The troupe was...not the best I've ever seen (felt very after-schoolsy), but had some standout performances and enough solid line-reading for me to forget about the flubs here and there.
