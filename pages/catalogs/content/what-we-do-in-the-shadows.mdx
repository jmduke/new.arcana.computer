(We watched seasons one through three.)

Wonderful and silly, like a very low-stakes live-action anime: there's a rich and inconsistent (but delightful) world, an emphasis on laughing with over laughing at, and a bunch of weird vampire stuff. It is not High Comedy and it is not perfect but I struggle to think of a single episode that we regretted spending the time to watch. (The first season starts a little slow, and then finds its form.)
