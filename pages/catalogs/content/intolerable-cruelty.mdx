This felt like the Coen brothers trying to do their version of [[Adam's Rib]]
(and George Clooney doing his version of Spencer Tracy). I certainly liked it _more_
than that film, even if I thought it was weak and diversionary. The script had a requisite
number of eccentricities, the cast was pretty and charming, and the whole thing was a lovely
time that was neither regrettable not particularly memorable.
