I struggle to think of anything too positive about this game besides the fact that it is mercifully brief. The entire conceit revolves around it hitting you over the head with references to the gaming canon, which is cute and sweet at first but it manages to get stale in, like, _two hours of gameplay_. Perhaps this is an issue of mismanaged expectations: if I had played this like a flash game I think I would have been impressed (and that's really the way to gauge it), but treating it like an "actual" game means it fails pretty much any test you give it. (One legitimate nicety, though â€” they did a good job with the graphics!)
