Incredible, incredible anime. The visual aesthetic alone is terrific, and the core premise is fun-if-not-revelatory, but the show's sense of humor and chaos (perhaps best encapsulated in Ozu, who reads most as like some sort of Shakespearean imp) just had me straight up grinning in every episode. I loved it, and it was fun, and it was delightful to watch.
