I don’t think this movie _quite_ succeeded at threading the line between satire and comedy-of-errors; the points where it wavered into what felt like gravitas (in particular the final act) felt like missteps. But the comedy — the script! the performances by Buscemi and Tambor! — was sensational, and I could have spent an extra hour listening to the insane banter.
