Hmm.

I am both a sucker and a critic of this genre of aphorism/poetry/short-essay format: I loved _300 Arguments_ even as I hate, well, the vast universe of tweet-sized thought leadership.  And the latter is what sprung to mind most often reading through this book over the course of a few days: there were some selections that I genuinely loved and found striking, and there were many many more that felt tedious and worn and, for lack of a better word, _ugly_. 

Perhaps that is the appeal (or the marketing exercise) in this kind of book: you get five hundred bullets and if you hit someone with a dozen of them you are successful. Maybe that sounds cynical: I don't even mean it in a negative way.
