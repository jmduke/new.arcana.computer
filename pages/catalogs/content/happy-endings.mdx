This, to me, is the perfect sit-com. It’s that simple: for two seasons (skip the first season; you don’t need it and the show tries to be too conventional) it shits out an outrageous level of humor with a cast that has a perfect chemistry. There is a tiny bit of “aw, shucks” relationship drama and camaraderie, but mostly it’s just about an insanely high number of jokes. This is the apex of the “six friends hanging out” show; there are shows that go in different directions with it (like [[How I Met Your Mother]] and their innovation/reliance on pseudo-postmodern narration) but I have yet to encounter a show that improves upon the formula.
