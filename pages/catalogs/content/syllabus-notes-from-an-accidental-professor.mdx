What is this book? It is hard to say. It feels like an art school version of Bird by Bird, in a lot of ways. It is sweet and vivid and deeply evocative of a professor who I think I would have hated in school but would love now â€” the prototypical art teacher. I don't know how I could recommend it to someone but I also don't know how I could tell someone not to read it.
