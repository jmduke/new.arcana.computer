It took me a little time to get keyed into the idiosyncratic humor & ethos of this show, but once I did I _really_ did. It's very much a shonen, but a shonen in a way that feels more committed to deconstructing stereotypes than [[Ousama Ranking]] and with characters that are at least right now (having not started the second season at all, though with great excitement to do so) feel more interesting and fluid. The animation and style is, while low-budget at times, always exciting and interesting (reminding me of some of the risks and chaos that made [[The Tatami Galaxy]] so enjoyable); the show never overplays its hand or leans too far into either comic relief or melodrama.

Also, Reigen is just the best. I struggle to think of an anime character who I like more than Reigen.
