The book is not groundbreaking, and it owes a lot (in terms of "MarketWorld" and "protocols") to James Scott, but I liked it more than I thought it would.  The distillation of a corporate "win-win" ethos was a pretty damning excoriation of my alma mater's consulting pipeline, and Silicon Valley's focus on raising tides.
