China Mieville is an author that I have heard mentioned and recommended in comparison to many writers I like —
Borges, Calvino, Jemisin — and yet had never really considered reading, perhaps because I didn't quite understand
his ouevre.

Well, I _loved_ this book. What I think Mieville does so well is take a a relatively interesting but low-rent premise
(that easily could be fashioned as a Borges short story) and, rather than beat it to death with the size and heft of a novel,
use it as the _background_ for an otherwise well-executed and satisfying crime novel.
