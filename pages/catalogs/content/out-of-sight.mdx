Very early Soderbergh, and you can see a couple blueprints here: his penchant for crime/heist stories with
jump-cutting timelines, his love for Clooney (who I think does a terrific proto-Clooney performance, with all
the charisma in the world but not quite the "I am playing myself, George Clooney" swagger that makes it hard to
take his later work seriously), a over-willingness to play with color grading and cross-fades. It's a fun movie
that I had a good time with even if it doesn't quite commit to being pure style + pomp (see: [[Ocean's Eleven]])
or pure grit (see: [[No Sudden Move]]).

It does _nail_ a couple things, though: the chemistry between Clooney and Lopez is both well-lampshaded in the
trunk scene and _delightful_ in their little hotel bar montage (it's hard to make the romantic elements of these
things work, and that was my least favorite part of [[Three Days of the Condor]], but it absolutely worked in that
scene), the ending, the surgical deployment of Ving Rhames.
