I am still digesting this book â€” I know that I liked it a lot, and I think it managed to succeed at almost
every level besides having more-than-workmanlike prose. It serves as a great assemblage of metaphors, as a gripping
murder-mystery, a terrifying horror film, and a deep question about what "reality" means and why the "real" matters.
