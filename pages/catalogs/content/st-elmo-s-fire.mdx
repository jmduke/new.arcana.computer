The piece of work that this reminded me *most* of was [[Friends From College]], which recency bias aside makes a lot of sense — both are pieces that are centrally interested in how raw and bizarre close college friendships can be *and* how quickly toxic and deleterious they become after graduation (obvious the show is talking about a timescale of decades, whereas *St. Elmo’s Fire* is only really interested in a year or two’s distance). I think this film does hit on some core emotional truths: the melodrama & the frankness-bordering-on-after-school-special felt *correct* to me. Unfortunately, the movies foibles are, uh, painful: the “Emilio Estevez turns into a stalker” storyline went from something that I could charitably refer to as parodic/resonant into Purely Weird AnD Bad super quickly; Rob Lowe’s character was only granted growth and serenity offscreen. I did not like these characters: I knew them, but I did not want to spend time with them, and I don’t think I would have liked them any more if I spent any more time with them.
