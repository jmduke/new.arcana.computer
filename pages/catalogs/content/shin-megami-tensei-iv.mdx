I picked this up because I had a hankering for JRPG gameplay that was mindless but not _too_ mindless, and boy has it fit the bill thus far. The Pokemon-style gameplay is easy to pick up and grok but it is _brutal_: I died something like five times in the little tutorial dungeon. Online comments indicate that the start of the game is the hardest (which is certainly true of Persona 5, the only other SMT game I've beat) but it's a good feeling of difficulty (except for the demon negotiations, which seem needlessly obtuse.)
