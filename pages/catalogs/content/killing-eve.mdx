The first season was messy and a bit spottily plotted but glorious: the acting was top notch, the subversions were all there, and it was just _joyous_. The plot alone would have been great, and the acting alone would have been great, and the aesthetic & costuming just brings everything over the top! 

The second season, though... much less so. No characterizations make sense; Sandra Oh’s character becomes uninteresting and unconvincing, and the plot feels... like fanfiction. (Someone called “The Ghost”? Really?) It left a bad enough taste in our mouths that we’re not interested in a third season, which is a shame. (I am going to start calling this the Mandalorian Effect.)
