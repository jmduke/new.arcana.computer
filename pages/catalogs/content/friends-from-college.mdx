A remarkable show (in the literal sense.) Clearly a talented writer's room that learned _way_ too late that the plotting and characters they had set up were absolutely insufferable, and by the time they started to course-correct in the second season it was too late. Billy Eichner's straight-man character was really well-done, and there are a couple moments of genuine glee (the first half of the finale!), but it was drowning in a sea of melodrama and uncharitable assholes.
