It was cute and nice but felt straight-up like a three-episode epilogue of the main series. In contrast, the Cowboy Bebop movie felt like more of a _distillation_ of what the show was about into a tighter movie with a stronger budget. Maybe I am just not super into the concept of OVAs; less of an issue with this as a movie and more about my expectations of it.
