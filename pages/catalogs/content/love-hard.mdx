This was a bad _movie_ but a pretty good _Christmas movie_. I laughed more than once (which, again, grading on a curve!) and
the entire production had a sense of everyone involved being in on the joke and having fun with a goofy, lighthearted
script. There was literally no connection between the two romantic leads, but they were affable enough on their own.

You should not, like, _watch_ this, but if you are forced into watching it (say, by a fianc√© who is a big fan of Christmas movies)
you could do much much worse.
