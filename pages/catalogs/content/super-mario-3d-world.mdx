This was comfort food. It was not as great as Super Mario Odyssey, but it felt like someone played Super Mario World and said "okay, what if we updated the graphics and just made it as fun as possible?" It was a little same-y and the difficulty wasn't _quite_ there, but I certainly had a good time playing. (It also doesn't outstay its welcome, a thing for which I am always grateful.)
