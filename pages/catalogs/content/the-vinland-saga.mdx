A bit of a slow-burn start with a few too many tropes, but I think the back half of the season â€” once we got into an interesting and multifaceted cast of characters and a sense of real unchartered territory (both _literally_ and in terms of plot) it really blossomed into something great. (Also, Thorkell is just a classically excellent character, a JRPG protagonist come to life, and his ethos and compass keeps the show from being a melodrama.)
