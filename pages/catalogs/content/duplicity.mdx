Nothing wrong with this one, and it's a clear descendant of the Ocean's Eleven school of thinking: get a really talented cast, add some espionage, and let them have a whole bunch of fun together.

Unfortunately, it has the Ocean's Twelve penchant for narrative confusion as substitute for narrative wit. I thought the slow reveal of parallel timelines was good (and the final twist at the end was nice, in an Agatha Christie "oh, that's clever!" sense) but it made things a little tricky to actually keep together (for instance, how did Clive Owen's character even get the formula given that they caught him with it?) or even care about / root for. A good way to spend a Sunday night because it is charming and well-crafted, but does not push the boundary in any particular way.
