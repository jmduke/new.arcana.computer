Early-era Grant and Hepburn: charming(ly obvious) plot, dynamite script, 97 minute runtime. I don’t know what’s not to love. It is not as obviously wonderful as Bringing Up Baby (which is still, I think, the funniest in the era) or The Philadelphia Story but I think it’s carried equally by the strength of the supporting cast.
