I picked this up on a lark at Eliot Bay visiting in early 2023; I am a sucker for short-run translations
and promises of Spanish magical realism. I was not disappointed; this was a fun, odd read about creation and
art and meaning that felt at times like Murakami and at other times like Borges. (Two trite names to drop,
I know, but I think that's a useful anchor for folks who aren't familiar with relatively obscure Mexican authors!)
