Haley wanted an "old-timey comedy", and we have run low on them, so I had to
do some crate-digging for this one. And I'm glad I did!

This movie — a svelte 82 minutes which it manages to wring
every minute out of, while leaving some time for breath and downbeat
— is really fun. Herbert Marshall (whom I haven't seen before this film,
but gives a lovely performance of Jack Lemmon playing Cary Grant) and Miriam
Hopkins are delightful, a sort of proto-[[The Thin Man]] pairing.

The plot feels every inch the three-act play from which it is adapted, and that
economy works in its favor: every scene advances and entertains. (I did not much
buy the third-act romance, but those things happen.)
