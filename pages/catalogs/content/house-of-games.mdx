In retrospect, I shouldn't have watched this so quickly after [[The Spanish Conversation]] and
[[No Sudden Move]]; I think this kind of heist/neo-noir is, as much as I love it, subject to a
bit of diminishing returns. To that end, I found myself disappointed with this to the extent that
the "ploy" quickly became obvious, and once you know to watch for the trick you get more interested
in the mechanics of the work than the work itself. This was ameliorated by an ending that I am sure
many hated but I found deeply subversive, and revealing of the true nature of both protagonists.

Would definitely recommend, even if my sheer enjoyment was on the lesser side.
