This movie is entirely style over substance, but — what style! It is _so_ fun to watch. The visual motifs are really, really well done, and the script is puerile and predictable but not necessarily _bad_. Mostly I am struck by how interesting and vivid the world is  — and how many rote plot twists & evolutions you jump through — relative to the short runtime, and it really feels like a sixty hour JRPG compressed into an incredibly stylish film (not that I’m complaining — I think the script’s cliches would have been much more painful on something with a long runtime, but the movie was very good about lampshading all of them.)

Also, the music is incredibly solid.
