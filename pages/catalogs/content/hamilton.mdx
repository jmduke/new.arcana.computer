I was not a Hamilton _hater_ exactly (I, like many other snoots, didn’t hate Hamilton so much as I hated the people who, for a brief but painful time, were really, _really_ into Hamilton) but I certainly was not a huge fan until Haley roped me into listening to the soundtrack. I liked the soundtrack; I thought it was clever and fun (until the second act, where things get a little cloying and fall off — but that’s probably true of most musicals, right?)

Anyhoo, we caught a performance in San Francisco when they were on tour in 2019 and it was a really fun time. I thought the cast was solid and the stagework was really well done; I’m not a big musicals guy so I don’t have a huge repertoire of past experiences against which to compare it but the choreography was a delight and it was three hours very well spent.
