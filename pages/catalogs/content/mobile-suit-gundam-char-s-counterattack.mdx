I think I was a little spoiled by [[Life is Short, Walk On Girl]] which took everything that the show did and amped it up to ten, rewarding (but not mandating) your understanding of the show's context and visual language. This was fun — the set pieces were delightful, especially for the time — but the core of the drama revolved around Char and Amuro who I have never seen before. That's on me, not on the film — but so much of the context felt prerequisite for the emotional arcs.
