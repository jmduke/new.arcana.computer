Murakami feels more and more like an old friend with whom I feel comfortable: most of the conversations and stories are ones we've had before, but it is still fun to banter and to rehash old arguments and think about the good times.

_Sputnik Sweetheart_ was completely unremarkable within his ouevre. It was a good book, and if it was my first Murakami I would probably hold it in higher esteem — it certainly feels like it could be a good entry into his world — but it wasn't, and I don't.  You can read it if you've never read Murakami before or if you're desperate for more, but I would never recommend it over, say, _Colorless Tsukuru_.
