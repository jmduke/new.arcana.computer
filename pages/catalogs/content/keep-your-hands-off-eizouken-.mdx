This is a very sweet, fun, imaginative, delightful show. I'm not really sure what else to say about it: it did not change my life, but every single episode made me either laugh or grin out loud. I am, in general, not a huge fan of slice-of-life (or perhaps to phrase it more accurately: non-fantastic) anime, but this was a clear exception, mostly because it takes great use of anime as a medium to explore the bounds of imagination and creativity.
