A one-season show that was not exactly a _wonder_, but it knew exactly what it was: low-prestige silly television. It had a terrific commitment to bits; Rob Lowe was terrific (essentially playing himself). Timothy Olyphant was terrific _literally_ playing himself. Fred Savage and Mary Elizabeth Wilstead were solid and game-y! The kids and side characters were poorly fleshed out but that would have been ameliorated with more time. I am going to miss this show; it deserved a second season, and the level of metacommentary it hit in the last few episodes (in particular the final scene of the show!) was worth the price of admission on its own.
