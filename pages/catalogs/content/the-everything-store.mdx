Halfway through this book, I wrote:

> i haven't finished quite yet, but The Everything Store is thus far the worst book i've read in the genre of corporate hagiography: prose like a wikipedia article, no sense of propulsion or cohesion, complete dearth of interesting reportage

Having finished it, I mostly stand by that remark, though I think I was being perhaps too harsh. It is certainly the worst book I've read in the genre, though it simply was trying to cover _too much_. Stone clearly did a lot of interviewing for this book, though his access to insiders was clearly gated on a certain position in his reporting; there was nothing in it that rang _false_ (as someone who spent four years in the company immediately following the publication of this book), but whether due to my intense interest & knowledge in the company or due to an attention to surface-level narrative over deeper insights nothing he wrote seemed particularly interesting as well? There are entire books' worth of material that are covered in paragraphs: I wanted to go deep into Amazon's setting up of new verticals or their process of FC scaling & selection or a play-by-play of the Kindle roll-out or _so many_ things that could have been interesting in depth, and instead he scratches the surface. (Maybe what I am saying is that I am not disappointed that it wasn't a more negative book. I am not a huge fan of Amazon but I think it is intensely interesting, and would benefit from a Caro-style microscope.)

Stone opens this book with a question from Bezos ("so how are you going to avoid the narrative fallacy?") which he fails to satisfyingly answer, and ends with a cloying anecdote about him writing an email to his birth father. Those two snippets bookend a few hundred pages that indeed read like a Wikipedia article: one with many footnotes, and one whose content might be interesting to someone completely new to Amazon's world, but they are devoid of insight or incision.
