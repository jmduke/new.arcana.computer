The obvious and deserved comparison is with Evermore/Folklore â€” a stripped down, mellower version of the author's ouevre. While I think Taylor's latest outings are good-not-great, I thought this was closer to _great_; the songwriting is steadier and more interesting, and the pathos hits a little stronger.
