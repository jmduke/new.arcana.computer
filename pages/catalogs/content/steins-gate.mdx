The show owns! I liked the back half much more than the front half, but the transition from silly slice-of-life to thriller was really well done, and the "working backwards" of it all turned out incredibly well I think. You grow attached to almost every character — even the protagonist shifts from anime annoying weirdo to someone you genuinely feel for — and the show made me legitimately laugh pretty often. Just very very well done!
