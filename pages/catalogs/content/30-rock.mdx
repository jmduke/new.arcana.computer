I've watched the thing front to back three times, including once during the show's initial run. There are things that haven't aged well — much hay has been made about a contrast between Amy Poehler's tendency to punch up and Tina Fey's tendency to punch down — and the show, like most seven-season network sitcoms, simply _runs out_ of stories to tell after a certain point, but here's the thing: it is simply a very funny show, that remains funny and interesting after three watchings, and it never thinks of itself as anything else than a show whose job it is to be as funny as possible, a task at which it almost overwhelmingly succeeds.
