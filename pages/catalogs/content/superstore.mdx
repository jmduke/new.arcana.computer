The good news about this album — really a collection of sketches, as hinted by the album art — is that if you don't like one track you just have to wait a minute to hear a completely different one. The bad news is that if you don't like one track you're probably not going to like a lot of them.

It really feels sonically akin to a very helter-skelter OST for an indie game. But there's just...no _there_ there. I did not have fun listening to it.
