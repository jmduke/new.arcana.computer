I thought this was great, and much more serious than the first part (and the prior reading of [Botchan](/content/botchan)) prepared me, even knowing that the book ended with Sensei's death.

I don't have a lot of specific thoughts, which is odd, because I am thinking _broadly_ about the book.  I think about how this book is largely in response to the Meiji Restoration, yet all of its claims to societal change (we no longer respect our elders! gender relations are changing! we care too much about wealth!) still sound resonant (and thus hollow) today.  I think about the particular love the protagonist has for Sensei, and how this border between love and idolatry is largely unexplored in Western literature I've read.  I think about, of course, [Hark! A Vagrant](http://www.harkavagrant.com/index.php?id=359).

But mostly I think about the final page, and the bravery of ending the book not with the story's final scene — Sensei's wife, discovering offscreen of her husband's death — but with the letter ending.
