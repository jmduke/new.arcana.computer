Incredibly good if not revelatory. Heston and Welles (and even Leigh!) were all amazing. The script was great and the core plot was tight (even if the script wasn’t a world-beater.) The opening shot is just as great as all of the direction following it. My only complaint, such as it is, is that I think the best noirs have to leave you with a little bit of emptiness or melancholy: they have to shake your belief a bit. The ‘twist’ ending (Welles’ hunch was right!) was a bit of this, but...I dunno. Not quite enough.
