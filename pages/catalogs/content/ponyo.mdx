I loved it! It was warm and sweet and gorgeous and there was nothing not to enjoy about it. The voice cast was solid, I loved all of the characters (even the miserly grandma throw-in who of course redeemed herself.)  It didn't hit the levels of, like, _transcendence_ that Totoro did â€” but it was still so, so good.
