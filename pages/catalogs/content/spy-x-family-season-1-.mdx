This show harbors no illusions about what it is or what it's trying to be, and I really admire it for that — this is a crisp season of silly, saccharine television. All of the characters are either extremely cute & charming _or_ vehicles to highlight the charm and cutes of other characters; the stakes are highlighted to be as low as humanly possible, and the aesthetics are beautiful (some of the details on the set design are really impeccable.)

It's not exactly 'slice-of-life' — there is a core plot, and there are action sequences — but it feels indebted to the ethos of 'slice-of-life', which is largely around feeling cozy around a bunch of characters. And it succeeds winningly at that. This is generally not the kind of show I love, but it works really well as a palate cleanser for heavier material.
