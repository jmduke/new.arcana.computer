I don't have anything profound to say about this movie:

- It is a rollocking good time, a classic family-friendly adventure
  story that feels nostalgic and (pleasantly) predictable if you've
  seen anything in its lineage
- It is _absolutely_ gorgeous: the animation is rich and detailed,
  the color palette is vibrant and varied, and the background work
  is [second to none](https://characterdesignreferences.com/art-of-animation-5/art-of-lupin-the-third-the-castle-of-cagliostro).
- It is funny!

I'm not sure what else to say. It's a great movie; it warms you. I
was surprised to discover just how much the character design of Cowboy
Bebop was modeled on the Lupin folks, which is an insight that I'm sure
I could have gleaned from _any other piece of Lupin media_, but still.

No notes; watch it, you're in for a terrific time.
