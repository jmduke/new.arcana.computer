What a weirdly unsatisfying season of television. I did not love WandaVision but it was something that was obviously _meant_ to be television: episodes were self-contained, interesting, and true to form.

This was a six-episode-long movie, and not a particularly well-paced movie at that. Hiddleston was okay! Jonathan Majors was _excellent_ (and should have been inserted much earlier than the finale.) Owen Wilson was fun but underused, and none of the other characters particularly mattered. Some of the special effects were particularly bad, and the script-writing was just....yeesh.
