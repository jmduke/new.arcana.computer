This was not a great movie, but it had one transcendent piece and one very nice piece that elevated it a bit in my mind:

1. A depiction of a Second Life-esque universe that was legitimately awesome both in terms of aesthetics and creativity, complete with the kind of creative character design that I would associate with something closer to a JRPG. 
2. A very, very sweet (and Persona-esque) deus ex machina moment that served as the very anime climax to the movie.

I don't think I'd handily recommend it to folks, but those parts were fun and inventive that it's worth a positive score.
