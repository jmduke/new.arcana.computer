I think I was spoiled by having read Circe first, which seemed like an utter improvement on its predecessor.  This book was good, and gave a depth and heft to the Iliad that pleased me — with Patroclus and Achilles' relationship being the apex — but the second act of the book (which is to say, when it became The Iliad proper) dragged and offered little.
