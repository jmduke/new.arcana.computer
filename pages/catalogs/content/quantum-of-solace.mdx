You know, the conventional wisdom is that the Craig Bond movies have been in a tick-tock nature: _Casino Royale_ is glorious, but _Quantum_ is bad; _Skyfall_ is glorious, and then _Spectre_ suffers.

And this is true to an extent. Watching this for the first time, after having watched _Casino Royale_ the night prior, highlighted its flaws in sharp relief. The cast is universally less interesting (with the exception of Fields, who I thought played her role superbly); the script is more muddled; the set pieces comically unrealistic.

But it also compared favorably in a few respects! The pacing of the film is, on the whole, better (it helps that it's forty minutes leaner!); the climactic showdown in the erstwhile hotel, while grandoise in true Bond fashion, was dramatic in a way that I don't think Casino Royale ever hit. And the general theme of the movie — Bond as an out-of-control widower — works having freshly seen the denoument of the previous film.

It's not, like, a _good_ film. But it is unfairly maligned, and fine by popcorn standards.
