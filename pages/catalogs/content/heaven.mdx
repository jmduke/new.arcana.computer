I picked this up last year on a lark, having recognized the other from [[Breasts and Eggs]] which I generally enjoyed.

This â€” well, I certainly didn't enjoy it, nor did I find it particularly good. A story of two middle schoolers bullied to the point of ruin (seriously: the thing borders on torture porn, a rawness that bludgeons you with its wanton cruelty) and their attempt to find some kind of solace: either through transcendence or through nihilism.

I am still digesting what Kawakami wanted to communicate with this book. Certainly the ending passage is meant to portray that the protagonist at least _felt_ as though his choice to rectify his physical faults was the correct one, a begrudging acceptance of Momose's nihilism. But it is hard to digest: when I think about this book, I will not be thinking about the way we should combat the ills of world because I will be too busy thinking about the number of pages the author devotes to a gaggle of middle-schoolers kicking the protagonist like a soccer ball.
