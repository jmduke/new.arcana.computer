Something I don't think I fully appreciated about the first two
seasons of this show, that becomes more obvious in time, is how
well the truncated runtime (each sketch is only a few minutes; each
episode is only ~15 minutes; each season only six episodes) works
with the one-note nature of the sketches. The show is very funny,
and its stupidity exits as soon as you think it might get stale.
