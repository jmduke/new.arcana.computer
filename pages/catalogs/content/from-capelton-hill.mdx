This is very much an album about what it means to have spent twenty years making music that is almost entirely about being in your late twenties and feeling that the most important parts of life are happening and fleeting. It is soft and comforting and you can't help but feel that, outside of the impressiveness that you're listening to it at all (I remember seeing Stars in DC in, what, 2010, and being blown away!) it feels a bit hollow, a bit like a cove
