I am starting to get a sense of PKD's entire thing being "what if you fell asleep, and had a dream, and then woke up — how do you know you're not still in a dream?" (First in [[Ubik]], now here.)

Snark aside, I really did love this — not quite as much as [[Ubik]], but it was an entirely fun and interesting time that leaves you with much to chew on, and is more explicitly religious (and much more menacing, albeit with some very sweet codas from our ostensible protagonist) than Ubik. An easy recommendation, even if I don't think it breaks into my personal canon.
