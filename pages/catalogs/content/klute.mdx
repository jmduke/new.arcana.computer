A terrific, terrific film, with a great performance by Jane Fonda (insert quip of "the film should be called
Bree!" here.) I think some of the noir aspects felt a little more obvious than in [[The Conversation]], but
the pair of performances and the deep sense of sonic dread that permeated the film made this one of the greatest
films I've seen in a while.
