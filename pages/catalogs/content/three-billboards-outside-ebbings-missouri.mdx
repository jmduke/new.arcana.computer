It is kind of funny to watch this film, six years after its release (and subsequent kerfuffle re: Sam Rockwell's character and
what it means to write a redemption arc for a racist cop). Martin McDonagh certainly has a _style_; I think you can lodge many
of the same complaints about this film as you can about [[The Banshees of Inisherin]] (the dissonance between black comedy and deep,
human tragedy feels more like whiplash than one might hope). A keen analysis of Aaron Sorkin's work is that his dialogue only _really_
works in settings where you expect everyone involved to be ultra-literate dorks with tremendous egos about what they do (c.f. [[The West Wing]], [[The Social Network]])
and in much the same way I think McDonagh's tendency towards violence and shock only works to its full effect in something like
[[In Bruges]], where you are meant to feel the distance between the characters' relationship to violence and your own.

But there is so much to enjoy in this film: the terrific score and cinema work, McDormand's battleaxe performance, Harrelson's beautiful
monologues. I do not think this was a Best Picture; it was still worth my time.
