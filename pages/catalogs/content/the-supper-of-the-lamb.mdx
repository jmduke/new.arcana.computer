Wow.

Move over [[An Everlasting Table]] (which is still a great book), _this_ is my favorite book on cooking. 

This is going to be a short review because I don't have much to say: I think Capon is a tremendous writer, I think his arguments and prose are beautiful and compelling, and I think he changed my behavior and the way I look at the world for the better. This writing is inventive, sincere, and divine. 

I'm going to go out and make some noodles this week!
