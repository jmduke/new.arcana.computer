This movie didn't have any reason to exist, but if the _previous_ animated Grinch didn't exist, I think people would like this one a lot! It was well-animated and well-voiced. Max the Dog (and of course Fred the obese reindeer) were very, very endearing. There were a bunch of solid visual sight gags. There's nothing to really malign besides its lack of raison d'etre.
