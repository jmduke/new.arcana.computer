Another finance book that I picked up with hopes of it being some combination of novel, actionable, interesting,
or at the very least idiosyncratic: another book I abandoned after it was clearly none of those things (though I
made it further than _The Boglehead's Guide to Investing_!)

This book has a few virtues: it is concise and not poorly-written, and the advice it offers is _good_. It's just
advice and understanding that you have probably gleaned from a variety of other sources already (saving is more
important than spending; calibrate your risk appetite depending on your age; that sort of thing). I would recommend
starting to read it and then making a quick decision after the first few chapters: if it's up your alley, continue,
and if it's not then feel comfortable dropping it.
