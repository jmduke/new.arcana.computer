Why does this movie exist? The answer is obvious: it is a commercial, not artistic enterprise,
and by those standards it is a success. It is a 90-minute commercial for _Mario_, slickly delivered
with rough voice acting but a pretty delightful score. There are many things that you point at and
say "ah, I remember _that_!" and that is the point. It is a movie that exists to remind you of
the fun you had playing _Mario_ games, and by the Ebert definition of a good movie (accomplishing
what it sets out to do) it is a good movie.

But there is a hollowness at the core of this movie that slightly witty asides like the melancholy
dark star cannot fix. Take, for instance, [[The Lego Movie]].
