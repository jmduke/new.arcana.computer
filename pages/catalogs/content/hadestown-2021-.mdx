It's not a masterpiece like the 2010 original, but — separated from its musical trappings — feels like something of a well-executed live action reboot. There are moments of repetition and subtext turned into text and those things aren't great, but it feels _good_ to spend more time in this world, and to drink a bit more of it than usual. (And the execution is tremendous, too, even if I miss Anais and Justin's original vocals.)
