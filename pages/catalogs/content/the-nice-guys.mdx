I will start with a proviso that I did not realize that this was a distinct film from [[The Other Guys]],
which in many ways feels like a spiritual predecessor to this film â€” elevated buddy cop comedy with some feints
towards a more serious plot. This was certainly a better film (which is not to say that I didn't enjoy The Other Guys);
the trappings of noir, an absolutely hilarious performance from Gosling, and a script that felt less all-caps and more
winking. A tremendously fun time that does not leave much of an impression.

(Also, what's the deal with all seventies-based films involving the catalytic converter conspiracy>)
