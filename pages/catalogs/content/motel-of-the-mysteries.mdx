This was a very cute novella — or perhaps not *quite* a novella. It felt more like, in terms of substance & depth, an SNL short or New Yorker humor bit blown up to fifty pages in size, the thesis of which (our general sense of sociological archaeology is probably way off) is sound and rubbed off on me a little. I think I was hoping at some sort of feint towards grandness, but the book was not interested in that (it was more interested in returning to the moist well of “lol toilets are used for sacred religious ceremonies” which, you know, fair!) Still, it was a cute way to spend thirty minutes and I can’t really recommend *buying* it but if you come across it in a library there’s no harm in curling up and devouring it quickly.
