The music was _fantastic_ and there were some real moments of beauty (the first big jam sesh; the school
talent competition; the final scene in the church). But the story's melodrama (even if true to life â€” I imagine
a lot of the love triangle aspects would have felt more 'real' if I was watching this back in high school or college)
dragged for me, especially given the time-jumps which meant the crux of every episode was less "slice of life" and more
"how did protag fuck it up this time?" I'm grateful for finally having watched it, even if it left me cold more than it
warmed me up.
