It is incorrect to describe this game as a melange of [[Celeste]] and [[Gris]] because of course
this game predates both of them. But that is where my mind went — this sort of "emotional platformer" —
and this game is terrific, ten hours of beauty and challenge and fun and very sweet characterization.

I think the gameplay was a _little_ less tight than Celeste; I think the exploration and non-linearity
felt a little unsatisfying (and I barely scratched the surface, it seems). But it was an absolute treasure
of an experience, and I'm excited to dive into the sequel soon.
