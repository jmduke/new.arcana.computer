Zero to One, not unlike other books in its zeigeist/self-caricature orbit ([[Sapiens]], [[Infinite Jest]], and so on)
is often so much treated like a referendum on _the kind of person who would read this book_ rather than the book itself.

This is perhaps a fairer book to be overshadowed by its author than Sapiens (reasonable, interesting pop-sci that happened
to be aggressively co-opted by Silicon Valley), given Peter Thiel and Blake Masters' [^1] place in the world. But still,
after twelve weeks of waiting for the library to get it in, I felt compelled to read it.

It's not bad! It's almost charming in its tendencies to wander off the garden path: Thiel will jump from a discussion of
evaluating potential co-founders to a pedestrian reading of Rawls' _A Theory of Justice_ to dressing up unique moats as "secrets"
and then a screed about the failure of "green tech."

The book is _short_, and contains little fluff (which means I am biased for it by default.) I think the advice it proffers is good,
albeit (at least at this point, nearly a decade after its initial publication) not particularly novel. The core of the book is the seven qualities of success:

1. Revolutionary technology
2. Unique insight
3. Monopoly status
4. Strategic timing
5. A great team
6. Effective distribution
7. Enduring value

Like, that's a pretty solid list, and not particularly idiosyncratic. I think a lot of people latch onto the whole "monopoly" thing, which is a smart
way for Thiel to dress up a fairly anodyne point (focus on overdelivering on a niche market and then expand) in a firebrand-y way. Which perhaps serves
as a useful metonymy for the entire book: Thiel delivers rote but useful advice in a way that is more interesting than your median airplane book.

[^1]:
    One takeaway from this audiobook, which was read by Blake Masters: I'm not sure how anyone could listen to his aural performance
    and consider him with the requisite charisma to mount a successful Senate campaign.
