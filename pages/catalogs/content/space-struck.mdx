I haven't been reading enough poetry lately, and so this might be a bit of a grading on a curve, but I thought this was lovely and light â€” funny without being try hard, sweet without being saccharine, and rarely revelatory but often ponderous. Paige's voice feels _real_ in a way that is hard to convey; this speaker is someone fleshy and realized, and I feel like I learned both from her and of her.
