Yes, it's clearly a record of its time â€” 2007 backpack rap through and through. But it's fun! And it's good! I am a sucker for all of the Seattle references, obviously, but the production is great and while the vocals are not exactly revelatory, the writing is solid (if not, again, an artifact of what it meant to be an alt-rapper in 2007). The thing holds up well.
