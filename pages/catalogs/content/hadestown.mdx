It was _delightful_ to get to see — or, really, listen — to this live, with the original recording cast and everything.  Reeve Carney's Orpheus was the lowlight of the entire affair (his acting was wooden and his singing did not exactly do his character justice), but everyone else was in form even rarer than in the recording studio. 

Eva Noblezada was _perfect_ and I think I would not be very surprised if she emerged as an absolute force over the next decade. The one surprising difference between the recording and the musical was the prominence of _The Fates_ as a true character and not just background singers, which certainly recontextualized the album. Beyond that, it felt like a very beautiful and well-done rendition of the soundtrack, which is to say the stagecraft was meager and meant to accentuate rather than elevate the music.
