It is almost impossible to review this game without comparing it to [[The Return of the Obra Dinn]],
a game which I felt in many respects the exact same about as I do about this one â€” a sense of respect
and love for the game and its commitments, a deep desire for there to be _more_ of the genre, and a deep
enjoyment that never quite crossed over into _love_.

There is a bit of a _purity_ to Obra Dinn that you can't help but love: it is a single narrative, a single
setpiece, a single gameplay loop. _Golden Idol_ is less so in that respect; you're broken up into stages
with tiny (well-done) tweaks in whodunit gameplay from stage to stage, and the narrative expands over
the course of years as you follow a fun little plot with elements of Indiana Jones and Agatha Christie.

It's rare that I'm disappointed by a game being over too quickly: it took me around four hours to beat this one,
and while I am grateful that the game didn't drag (and I think the ratio of plot-to-gameplay is perfect) I found myself
wishing for _just a little more_. This is perhaps the noted difference between the two games: when I finished Obra Dinn
I felt a deep sense of completion and a desire to play something, anything else; when I finished _Golden Idol_ I found
myself wishing there was even more. (Both good feelings in their own way!)
