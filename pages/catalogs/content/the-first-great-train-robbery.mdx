There were a few particularly memorable bits to Connery's performance — his scene peeling and eating an orange, and his absurd over-the-top double entendres — and there is of course a comfort that a Merely Good Heist Movie bestows, but that's all this was: merely good.  It was two hours that were entertaining and utterly predictable and that's not a bad thing!
