I remember going through these stories in an udon place on 15th, with the first long September rain coming down outside. I didnâ€™t really know what Carver was about at first; his stories are short and sad and disquiet. I had to pause between them and watch an episode of HIMYM or go for a walk or something to keep my mind off of them.
