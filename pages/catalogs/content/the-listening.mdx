I was perhaps over-excited after listening to [[The Minstrel Show]] — a 10/10 album for me, and the first I've run into in a while — and had to start binging their discography. This was fine, and good, and Big Pooh continues to bang, but it just doesn't compare. I think I might come back to it in a few weeks so that I don't have the lingering tastes of their following album in my mouth; right now this just feels _less fun_ than the successor.
