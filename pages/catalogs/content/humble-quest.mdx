Pitchfork describes this album as "matter-of-factly masterful", and I think that's apt! This is need something that breaks out of its country-pop confines, but it's a very pleasant and mellifluous country-pop album that feels good for warm Sunday afternoons. It is sweet and well-produced and I smiled listening to it.
