This is probably my least favorite season of Fargo and it was still really solid.

- Terrific acting. Chris Rock (and Glynn Turman) were spectacular.
- The Wizard of Oz episode was a singular triumph and one of the best episodes in Noah Hawley's quiver.

But the entire thing was just _too long_. This was eleven episodes that could have been trimmed down to eight fairly easily; it feels like a consequence of Hawley's stature within FX being so sacrosanct that nobody can tell him no. (That's projection, of course, but if he was going to be indulgent I would have preferred him to be at least _interestingly_ indulgent.)
