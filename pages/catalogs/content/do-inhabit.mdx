It feels almost mean to rate this book so low. It was not a _bad_ book, it was just a wisp of a book: pretty and insubstantial and vacuous. 

I am no interior designer, but it taught me very little (beyond _prutsen_, a Dutch word for pleasantly/aimlessly tinkering, which is delightful!) that you don't pick up from a handful of Tumblr blogs (pictures of which are strewn throughout the book.) Advice from the authors are either bizarrely specific (only mount things two feet from the couch) or helplessly vague (bring nature in by adding rocks and wood to your living room).

There's nothing wrong with the book: if you have eight dollars and an hour to spare you'll probably enjoy it more than reading through Twitter.  But you can do much better than this, I think.
