Wow. 

This brings me back to two albums in particular: Camp Lo's [[Uptown Saturday Night]] and Kanye's [[The College Dropout]] — less in terms of sound and production (though the Kanye—9th Wonder connection is of course very obvious) and more in terms of just _sheer entertainment value_. This record has it all: a concept that makes the skits worth sitting through, comedy, pretty incredible verses, and just delightful production. It's so rare for me to listen to an album — even one that I really, really like — and then immediately listen to it five more times. _Five!_ 

More than anything, this record has a mise en place. It has an opinion and a worldview that it defines well and then you just get to live in it in a really delightful way for forty-five minutes. It's fun from start to finish. I don't know what else to say about it.
