Gorgeous cinematography; really really lovely denouement; pretty fun and chill time overall. 

And yet, feels regressive compared to, say, Bringing Up Baby (maybe I'm biased from having spent July watch Grant / Hepburn vehicles?) despite coming out fifteen years latter. Peck doesn't play lighthearted well, and Hepburn is obviously luminous but there isn't a tremendous amount of moment-to-moment chemistry (again, excepting those final scenes.)
