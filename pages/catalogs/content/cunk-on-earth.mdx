I have recommended _Cunk on Earth_ a lot to friends over the past week, which was exactly how long
it took for Haley and I to devour the five-episode miniseries, a writer's-room sendup of David Attenborough-style
documentaries that averages a joke a second and a laugh a minute.

I complain often of modern comedies being unwilling to stick to their lane, so to speak: most critically
acclaimed comedies of the past ten years have great writing but also, like, plots about the long-term effects
of parental trauma ([[Bojack Horseman]]) or debilitating mental illness ([[You're the Worst]]). There is nothing
wrong with this: I love those shows.

But also I admire a comedy that steers all elements in service of making you laugh, and there is a reason that
my two favorite comedies of all time are [[30 Rock]] and [[Happy Endings]] — they are vehicles for getting you to
laugh as much as possible, and everything they do is in service of that goal. _Cunk on Earth_ is a comedy in this
vein: it is deeply stupid, and hits the same six or seven genres of joke over and over again, and if that is
what you are looking for — if you are _tuned into its frequency_, so to speak — you will have a great time.
