Every year, the Jose Gonzales Trio put on a live performance of the Charlie Brown Christmas soundtrack to raise funds for the Strawshop Theatre (a troupe of which I'm a fairly ardent supporter.) It is perhaps my favorite part of Christmas, and this is a recorded version of that music.  And, I mean, I _love these guys_ but there's no improving on the original.
