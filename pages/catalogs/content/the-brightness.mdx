This is a nice album, and it is fun to listen to Anais suss out some of her work and get a glimpse into her maturation (Hades & Persephone made it all the way to Hadestown!) but the songwriting here is just _weaker_ than _Young Man In America_, a perfect gem of a folk record. This feels sparser, muter, and less interesting, though still nice.
