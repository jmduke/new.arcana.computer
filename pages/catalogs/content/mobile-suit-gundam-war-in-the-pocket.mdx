This is the first Gundam show I've watched since my Toonami days, and it was â€” excellent. There was nothing silly or sophomoric; it was a mature and frankly brutal miniseries on the cost of war. What was surprising to me was how "un-Gundam" it was; there were maybe two or three mecha battles and really there was nothing unique about them that couldn't have been expressed in, like, climactic shootouts of any other sort. 

Also, the music was _great_
