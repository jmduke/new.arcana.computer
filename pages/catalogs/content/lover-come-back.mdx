The good: "Vip" is an incredible bit with a pretty solid payoff; the Hudson-Randall chemistry is impeccable (even if the Hudson-Day chemistry is less delightful than in [[Pillow Talk]]); Doris Day's dresses; the gentle skewering of the advertising industry; the wisecracks.

The bad: Doris Day's hats; a paint-by-numbers third act; a feeling of having seen this all before.

All in all, averages out. There's no reason to watch this if you've already seen [[Pillow Talk]], but there's no reason to run away from it screaming.
