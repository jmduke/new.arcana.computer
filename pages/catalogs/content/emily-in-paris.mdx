Two things I will share about Emily In Paris, a truly bad show:

1. It is at least an _entertainingly bad_ show. It has no illusions about being good, and it is quite fun to yell at it: the writing so awful, the characters so cliche, the production so silly. (My favorite part of the entire thing is how the characters talk to themselves in English even when the protagonist — who is mocked and hated for speaking in English — is not around!)
2. The one saving grace of a show like this could be the music and yet it is somehow so deeply uninspired and lazy. I truly don’t understand it.
