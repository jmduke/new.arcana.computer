What to say about this show that isn’t damning with faint praise?

The first three episodes were terrific, and amongst the best things Marvel has done. Every time after that we exited “the universe of the show” it sucked! Why are we dealing with the most generic bad guy in the world! Who gives a shit about these awful action scenes? Why do we have to pull the most obvious subtexts into the foreground?

The answer, of course, is that because this is a Marvel property, and I am not the perfect audience — I liked this despite its MCU heritage, not because of it. But there was a path for this show to be truly great, and it’s a bummer that they steered away from it. (Maybe what I wish is that this show was Legion, which this certainly took a few beats from.)
