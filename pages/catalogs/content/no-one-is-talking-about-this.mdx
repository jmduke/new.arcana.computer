The first half of the book is a vacuous and entertaining Sporcle quiz of 2016â€”2018 Twitter zeitgeist; the second half of the book is sweet and wonderful and rapturous. 

It's not great literature, but Lockwood is a tremendously good writer. It is saccharine, but who cares if it made me cry and think? I think it is a book that I loved more than I liked, and I think if you have a brain similar to mind you would find it very good and very moving, even if there is a _tad_ too much solipsis
