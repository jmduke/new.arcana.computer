Season one: terrific, and my favorite piece of Star Wars content ever. I get that it's just a space veneer around Westerns, but its done _so damn well_ â€” the characters are engaging and interesting, the direction & score is fantastic. I can't really think of any huge complaints.

Season two: they certainly doubled down on the Star Wars, didn't they? This was a bit of a disappointment: the music was lovely and there were a couple of really great emotional beats (the final ten minutes of the season were wonderful not because of the big spoiler but because of the tearful goodbye Mando gave), but overall this felt too fanservicey. Too many gratuitous action scenes; too many backdoor pilots; too much Star Wars talk.
