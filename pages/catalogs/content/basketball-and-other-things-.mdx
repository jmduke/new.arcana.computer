This is a very fun book that is just a collection of three dozen Ringer prompts or /r/NBA shitposts. I don't mean that in a negative way â€” the book (and it calls this out in the prologue!) is not a thing to sit down and read because it's very silly and same-y. Also, the illustrations are fantastic. But you're not going to learn anything about the NBA or fandom from reading this, it's mostly just a fun collection of snippets.
