I wrote of season two:

I think all of that remains true for season three, but _more so_. It was not my favorite of all time,
but I had a blast watching it and it really nailed the ending, an important and fairly rare thing in
series like these. Some of the inciting incidents that led to arcs (a car hits Mob? C'mon.) were a bit
over the top, but the show earns its pathos.
