I was very surprised to neither like nor love this movie, given the amount of affection I have for all of
its constituent parts: Soderbergh, Zazie Beetz, sports business, and the NBA. But there was a _thinness_ to
the entire thing that made me wishing (so rarely!) for a longer run-time; characters felt like avatars than actual
people (with the exception of Beetz, who seemed to play a prototype of her [[Full Circle]] character), and the
final third resolved with the aplomb of an air leak.
