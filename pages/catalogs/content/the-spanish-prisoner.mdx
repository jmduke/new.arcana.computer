I really, really, _really_ liked this film, and my only criticism of it is that the cool distance with which it operates
makes it hard to love. Steve Martin is terrific, Mamet's dialogue is _perfect_ — arcane and precise and distinct without
detracting from your understanding of the events — and the progression of intrigue and revelation is masterful. The only
fault I can assign it is that it lacks any sort of emotional resonance, which sounds like a more biting criticism than I mean it to be.
