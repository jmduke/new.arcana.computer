When I listened to [[Potential]] six years ago I was absolutely blown away: in retrospect, it was my first house album, but it was a sort of album that felt simultaneously alien and warm, like something that I'd never really touched before. 

This album felt like...more of the same, but not in a good way. I was worried that maybe this was a bit of nostalgia, so I relistened to the original album â€” nope! Potential was still _that_ good. This album is fine, and not poorly crafted, but it does not do what that first debut did.
