I struggle to think of analogues for this — four short, sweet episodes about “the evening of the world”, a quiet and blissful post-apocalyptic slice-of-life. It is ethereal and wistful and deeply, deeply warm — not an easy task for an anime which stars two robots and two humans, none of whom really talk or develop that much. The only two complaints I can level against the show: it was too short (give me more of this in the same vein!) and this felt so clearly like _snapshots_ of a rich and veiled world, rather than a number of things that added up to a gestalt.
