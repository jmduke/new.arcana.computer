This was a very well executed show. Great acting, direction, and cinematography. The plotline was predictable and each little twist and turn felt a trifle on the cheesy side, but I didn’t mind that much — I think it lowered the ceiling of the show to have the developments be as rote as they were, but it was still gripping and thrilling. I particularly enjoyed the warmth and humanity that the show gave to the bit roles: the druggist, the lovelorn former rival, etc. 

(Oh, but the ceiling chess is dumb as hell.)
