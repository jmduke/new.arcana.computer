It is hard to find much positive to say about this movie. Jennifer Lawrence performed capably — certainly not to the standard
of a true A+-lister, but capably — and there were a couple pretty entertaining set pieces. It is hard to believe this was not
a Netflix movie with how heavily it skewed towards paint-by-numbers standards. But it was at least satisfactory in terms of
letting Haley and I turn our brains off after an extremely hectic wedding weekend.
