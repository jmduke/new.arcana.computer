This was very, very well done. The Grahame-Bogart interplay was fantastic on both sides: the one shot of them in the throes of lust, sharing a cigarette at a crowded piano bar, is probably the most charming Bogart has ever been. The ending (in its wryness) was a little bit choreographed but I can't really blame the film for that as much as I blame the film's influence (or perhaps the fact that I've just seen so much noir at this point), and Bogart's descent into — for lack of a better term — mania was really well done, and something you don't see a lot of in his earlier work is the gradation in character: not just the stoic mercenary and not just the heartened madman but the whole spectrum ebtween the two.
