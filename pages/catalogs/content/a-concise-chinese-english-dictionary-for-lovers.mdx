I liked the book. I found it charming and winsome and funny.  There were no elements, of, like, transformative exultation: so many of the books in this genre, the woman’s bildungsroman, the Dept. of Speculations and the Bluets of the world, have a couple moments that totally and utterly arrest me.  Concise didn’t have any of that — but it was funnier than those books.
