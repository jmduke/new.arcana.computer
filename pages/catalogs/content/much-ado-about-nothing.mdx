It is always fun to watch older films like this, that seem sort of like
a cinematic supergroup in retrospect: Denzel, Emma Thompson, Robert Sean Leonard,
Keanu Reeves, Kate Beckinsale (in her debut role, looking quite literally like
a fourteen-year-old despite Wikipedia insisting otherwise!). It has most of it's merit
in watching on those grounds alone: a fun rom-com with a bunch of stars that you've
grown to love. (And also Michael Keaton playing some sort of faux-Beetlejuice trope which
is bizarre and oddly endearing.)

The film runs for under two hours. The script is Shakespeare, expertly adapted and delivered.
It is riotously funny; the utter lack of chemistry between RSL and the nubile Beckinsale is
compensated for by the chemistry between Denzel and Thompson (and, of course, Branagh and Thompson).

It is an _extremely_ good time, if never a revelation or a masterpiece. I cannot get the idea of a
double feature — this and [[The Tragedy of Macbeth]], Denzel and Denzel, thirty years later — out
of my head.
