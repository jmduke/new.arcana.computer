I would probably have loved this album even more if:

1. Sledgehammer was not on it.
2. I had listened to it ten years ago so I could base entire swaths of my personality around it, as I have done with Graceland

It is glorious, though, and I'm probably gonna go down a Peter Gabriel rabbit hole now.
