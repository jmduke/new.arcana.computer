It is hard for me to imagine a more perfect novella, or a novella that takes more advantage
of its economy and delivers everything you want: spare, surgical prose, a rapid and satisfying plot,
an infinite mirror-palace of images and symbols upon which to meditate.

I picked this up by chance in Rizzoli's in New York (one of many books in our annual New York bookshopping-cum-cocktailing spree),
and I am excited to find more of Zweig's work.
