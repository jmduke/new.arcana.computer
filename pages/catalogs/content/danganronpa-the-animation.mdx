It is rare for me to complain that I wish a show was longer, but: I wish this was longer! The tropey interplay was fun but there wasn't that much of it because 13 episodes meant an _extremely_ tight arc, and the most fun aspects of these sorts of shows — getting to try and figure out the mystery before the show reveals it — is nigh-impossible because the actual investigation scenes happen in the span of seconds. The setting is weird and fun and the characters are great, but too brief — really all this did was act as an effective advertisement for the game on which it was based.
