Objectively a fun, good movie. (I don’t know about “best romantic comedy of all time” — When Harry Met Sally still holds that crown in my opinion — but it’s up there.) The Grant-Hepburn-Stewart trifecta was great, though I was surprised to learn that this was late in the Grant-Hepburn partnership (their chemistry felt off, especially having watched Bringing Up Baby so recently); Hepburn and Hussey were honestly the standout performances, and the script was just the right blend of screwball and sly.
