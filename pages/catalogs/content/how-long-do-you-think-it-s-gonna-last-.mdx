Mostly a reminder that Anais Mitchell is perfect and I need to listen to her more often. Less glibly, I thought this was as good-not-great as a side project gets: it suffers from lack of gestalt (as evinced by the lackluster second half) but the songs are pleasant and good even if they don't quite cohere.
