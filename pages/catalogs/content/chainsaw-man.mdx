I had heard of Chainsaw Man for a while from following some folks on Twitter who are much more plugged into the manga scene than I am [^1], and to say
I was dubious would probably be an understatement.

If you, like me, hear the title "Chainsaw Man" and feel _some sort of way_ about it, I can assure you that the show is not what you think it is. It's almost a bit of a
shonen deconstruction in much the same way [[Ousama Ranking]] or [[Mob Psycho 100]] feels like a twist on the genre, but this is... more so. The comparison I reach to,
almost involuntarily, is something like 100 gecs â€” brash, overconfident, maximalist, _fun_. It's a very weird show with whiplash pace, _gorgeous_ animation, and more
pathos and humor than I expected of it or its genre.

I don't think there's a single season of anime that I am _more_ excited for than the second season of Chainsaw Man. It's funny, beautiful, and interesting.

[^1]: I have read exactly two manga in my life; nothing against the form, I just don't really have the space or inclination for it.
