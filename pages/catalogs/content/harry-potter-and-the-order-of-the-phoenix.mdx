What a joyless two hours. Some notes:

- An important test for a fiction is: does it imbue its villains and obstacles with any redeeming or interesting characteristics whatsoever? (The answer here, of course, is no.)
- Helena Bonham Carter appears to be the only person in this movie who knows that it is a fantasy film and that it is okay to emote.
- Nothing happens! There is so much angst and nothing interesting or useful happens that isn't a death! Who gives a shit about the prophecy!
- Okay, the final wizarding duel is pretty fun, and a marked step up from the tug-of-war climax of the fourth movie.
