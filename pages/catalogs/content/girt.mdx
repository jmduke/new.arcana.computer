The book is unabashedly fun and humorous *and* I felt like I learned a decent amount about a subject about which I knew nothing — Australian history. The author takes more of a survey approach, which is something I struggle with a bit in historical books and non-fiction: it is less an overall narrative in some places than a collection of escapades. But the ultimate question for an author (if not a book) is “would you read another?” and there is a followup, the aptly titled “True Girt” (you have to respect when someone commits to a bit so hard they go for a punny book title), and the answer is yes!
