It's embarrassing that listening to the [[Scott Pilgrim V. The World]] version of _Black Sheep_ was the forcing function to get me to finally listen to Metric after all of these years (as a former Broken Social Scene, Stars, etc. obsessive) but....I was missing out! This is the exact kind of album 2009 Justin would have swooned over, and even now I think it held up well â€” punchy but with a bit of depth, and something that clearly rewards a bit of relistening.
