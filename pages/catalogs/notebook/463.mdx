1. Three posts a week, more or less.
2. One idea per post. If I find myself launching into another section, cut and paste the extra into a separate draft post, and tie off the original one with the word “Anyway.” Then publish.
3. No hedging, no nuance. If I’m getting in a twist about a sentence, take it out.
4. Give up on attempting to be right.
5. Give up on providing full links and citations.
6. Give up on saying anything new. Most people haven’t read my old stuff. Play the hits.
7. Give up on trying to be popular. I try not to filter myself based on what I believe will be popular. Some of my favourite posts get ignored. Some posts get popular and I have no idea why. Besides, terrible posts get buried fast if I’m posting three times a week. So post with abandon.
8. Give up on trying to be interesting. Readers will come to my site for what’s interesting to me, or not, it’s fine, just say what I think about whatever I’m thinking about.
9. But make it work for a general audience.
10. Only write what’s in my head at that exact moment. It’s 10x faster.
11. If it’s taking too long to write, stop.
12. Don’t use a post just to link to something elsewhere. If there’s a point to make, start with that.
13. Titles should be descriptive and have the flavour of the post. And rewrite the lede once the post is done so the whole thing gets to the point faster.
14. It’s ok not to blog if it feels like a chore.
16. Writing is a muscle.
