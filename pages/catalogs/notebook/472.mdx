1. How would I feel if I said yes to this request and it led to me not having time for an important request in the future?
2. Is it possible for me to suggest someone who could grow from taking on this opportunity or is better-suited for it?
3. Do I genuinely think this is high-value work? Would it matter if no one did it?
4. Do I want to do it?
5. Does this help me grow a skill I want to have?
6. Is this how I want to spend my non-core hours this week?
7. Am I okay with this work competing with my other goal of being an independent member of my new team?
8. Could I glue-work roll for it?
