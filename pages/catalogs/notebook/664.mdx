Yes, we shall live, Uncle Vanya.

﻿We’ll live through the long, long days,

﻿and through the long nights.

﻿We’ll patiently endure
the trials that fate sends our way.

﻿Even if we can’t rest,

﻿we’ll continue to work for others

﻿both now and when we have grown old.

﻿And when our last hour comes

﻿we’ll go quietly.

﻿And in the great beyond, we’ll say to Him

﻿that we suffered

﻿that we cried

﻿that life was hard.

﻿And God…

﻿will have pity on us.

﻿Then you and I…

﻿we4l see that bright, wonderful,

﻿dreamlike life before our eyes.

﻿We shall rejoice, and

﻿with tender smiles on our faces,

﻿we’ll look back on our current sorrow.

﻿And then at last

﻿we shall rest.

﻿I believe it.

﻿I strongly believe it
from the bottom of my heart.

When that time comes,

we shall rest.
