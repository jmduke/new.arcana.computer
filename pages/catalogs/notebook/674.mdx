Yuri Orlov: [when Andre suddenly shoots a subordinate with the sample gun from the main table in the center of his palace] WHY'D YOU DO THAT?
Andre Baptiste Sr.: What did you say?
[aims at Yuri]
Yuri Orlov: [pulls himself together] Well, now you're gonna have to buy it. It's a used gun!
[pulls it out of Andre's hand. Andre's bodyguards draw on him]
Yuri Orlov: How can I sell a used gun?
[Yuri huffs and busies himself wiping and polishing it]
