This day completes my twentieth year: and yet I am good for
nothing, and cannot even carry myself forward in the world:
three long years I have yet to study in order to qualify myself for
business: and then-oh! and then; how many more years, to
plod along, mechanically, if I should live; before I shall really get
into the world? Grant me patience ye powers! for I sicken, at the
very idea: thus is one third of a long life employ'd in preparing
to act a part during another third; and the last is to be past in
rest and quiet waiting for the last stroke, which places us just
where we were 70 years before. Vanity! Vanity! all is vanity and
vexation of spirit.
