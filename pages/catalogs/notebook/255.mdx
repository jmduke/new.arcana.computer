Recently, a friend observed that watching this show, often enough, we do not laugh anymore. I supposed that was right, and we wondered why, agreeing that its humor had not diminished with age. “It’s like being with an old friend,” I ventured. “With whom you can be comfortable in silence.”

“No,” he said, making a face. It wasn’t like that at all.

“Well, what then?” I said. “It’s like something.”

“Yes,” he said. “Do you know what it’s like? It’s something like being home.”
