Contrary to popular opinion, you can read too many books. It did something to my brain at an impressionable age. It left me not quite adjusted to real life; always one step removed. An observer, always seeking out dramas, consciously or otherwise, but in a dislocated way. I would look out of the windows of cars, buses, trains and see the projections of cinema on the panes, rather than a solid world go by. It seemed to instil in me a dangerous curiosity and an even more dangerous hesitancy.
