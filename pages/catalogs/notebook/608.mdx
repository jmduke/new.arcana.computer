Why when the various examples of a metropolis are defined by pedestrians, the number of cards, speed, or traffic, does Carrion analyze the Catalan capital using side streets? Because, says Carrion, in each side street "we find the affirmation and negation of the entire city." Those passageways, hyperlinks, connections between places or concepts that are netiher roads nor streets, ignore or elude by pausing the vertigo of traffic. Barcelona's side streets are footnotes, tunnels that take us "to what is beneath the page, beneath the urban text."
