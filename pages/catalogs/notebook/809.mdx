I know some of you were top of your class in high school. Maybe you're used to getting 100% on math tests. Well, this is engineering, not math. If you graduate at the top of your engineering class, we should fail you. It means you didn't learn engineering. You wasted your time. Unless you're going to grad school, nobody in the world cares if you got an 80% or a 99%. Do as little work as you can, to learn most of what we're teaching and graduate with a passable grade and get your money's worth. That's engineering.
