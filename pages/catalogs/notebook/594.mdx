One of the general themes that I've become more and more convinced by over time is that all the upside is in... all the expected value's in the upside tails and not in the median outcomes usually. And you should take that seriously. And it implies weird things, which I think are true. Like that often the right path is the one that very well might fail. You really should be thinking the whole time about what is the upside? What's it look like? Where is it? What can you do that will keep that in mind, even if you're not using it to make everyday decisions, but from a high-level strategy perspective
