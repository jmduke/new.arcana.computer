         "Follows here the strict receipt
          For that sauce to dainty meat,
          Named Idleness, which many eat
          By preference, and call it sweet:
          First watch for morsels, like a hound
          Mix well with buffets, stir them round
          With good thick oil of flatteries,
          And froth with mean self-lauding lies.
          Serve warm:  the vessels you must choose
          To keep it in are dead men's shoes."
