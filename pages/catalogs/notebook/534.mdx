We went up and down streets, stopping and starting.

"O.K., which way are we going now?"

"West."

"No, we're going south."

We drove along in silence some more.

"Suppose I pushed you out of the truck now and left you on the
sidewalk, what would you do?"

"I don't know."

"I mean, how would you live?"

"Well, I guess I'd go back and drink the milk and orange juice you just
left on the porch steps."

"Then what would you do?"

"I'd find a policeman and tell him what you did."

"You would, hub? And what would you tell him?"

"I'd tell him that you told me that 'west' was 'south' because you
wanted me to get lost."
