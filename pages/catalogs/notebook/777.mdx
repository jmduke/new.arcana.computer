You need to run, climb, kill!

You need to help each other.

You see someone who's confused, someone who is lost, you get them moving and you keep them moving until we put this place behind us.

There are 5,000 of us.

If we can fight half as hard as we've been working, we will be home in no time.

One way out!

One way out!

One way out!
