The Chicago accent is the night shift, the factory worker, the airport baggage handler. It is firefighters, garbage collectors, and busdrivers. It is bad coffee, the funniest guy in the breakroom, and the six days a week for one day off with your family. It is neighborhood know-it-alls and backseat loudmouths. It is complaining about the weather, the mayor, the city that you love. It is a bbq with family and the first snap of a sausage when you bite into it. If the Chicago accent is ugly, then it is an acknowledgment that work in America is ugly, for nobody works like Chicago.
