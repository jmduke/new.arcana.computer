Power makes you lazy. Insofar as our earlier theoretical discussion of structural violence
revealed anything, it was this: that while those in situations of power and privilege often
feel it as a terrible burden of responsibility, in most ways, most of the time, power is all
about what you don’t have to worry about, don’t have to know about, and don’t have to do.
Bureaucracies can democratize this sort of power, at least to an extent, but they can’t get rid
of it. It becomes forms of institutionalized laziness. Revolutionary change may involve the
exhilaration of throwing off imaginative shackles, of suddenly realizing that impossible
things are not impossible at all, but it also means most people will have to get over some of
this deeply habituated laziness and start engaging in interpretive (imaginative) labor for a
very long time to make those realities stick.
