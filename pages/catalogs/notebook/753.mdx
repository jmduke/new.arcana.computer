There is no point in having a 5-year plan in this industry.
With each step forward, the landscape you're walking on
changes. So we have a pretty good idea of where we
want to be in six months, and where we want to be in
30 years. And every six months, we take another look at
where we want to be in 30 years to plan out the next
six months.

It's a little bit shortsighted and a little bit not. But any
other approach guarantees everything you release is
already obsolete.
