Ellie Andrews: You know, this is the first time in years I’ve ridden piggyback.

Peter Warne: This isn’t piggyback.

E: Of course it is.

P: You’re crazy.

E: I remember distinctly my father taking me for a piggyback ride.

P: And he carried you like this?

E: Yes.

P: Your father didn’t know beans about piggyback riding.

E: My uncle, mother’s brother, has four children and I’ve seen them ride piggyback.

P: I’ll bet there isn’t a good piggyback rider in your whole family. I never knew a rich man yet who could piggyback ride.

E: You’re prejudiced.

P: You show me a good piggybacker and I’ll show you a real human. Now you take Abraham Lincoln for instance. A natural born piggybacker. Where do you get all of that stuffed-shirts family of yours?

E: My father was a great piggybacker.
