In a decade of working closely with other managers I’ve seen that there are almost always chronic under-performers that should be managed out. I believe that doing this quickly does more for team performance than any amount of rewards for top performers ever could. Sure, it destabilizes the team when someone leaves. Perhaps we can improve this by making attrition more transparent and natural. We tend to regard attrition targets and employee turnover as a “dystopian nightmare,” but I don’t see why it has to be. Given that a successful enterprise must precisely transcend the individual, one way to make the enterprise more antifragile is to make it less dependent on individuals. This is a radical shift away from the kinds of heroics and 10x impact that we have conventionally celebrated in Silicon Valley, but I believe it is time for that to change. A truly enlightened team knows that its time will end, and still accelerates towards that end, whatever mystery lies beyond.
