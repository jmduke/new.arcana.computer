The output of knowledge workers is extremely skewed based on focus. The productivity tiers seem to be:

1. Less than 10% focused on the job at hand: meaningful risk of getting fired.
2. 10-50% focus: “meets expectations,” gets regular raises.
3. 50%+ focus: superstar, 10x engineer, destined for greatness.
