Here's what [Friedman] says:

    I stomped off, went through security, 
    bought a Cinnabon, and glumly sat at the
    back of the B line, waiting to be herded 
    on board so that I could hunt for space 
    in the overhead bins.

  Forget the Cinnabon. Name me a herd animal 
  that hunts. Name me one.

  This would be a small thing were it not for 
  the overall pattern. Thomas Friedman does 
  not get these things right even by accident. 
  It's not that he occasionally screws up and 
  fails to make his metaphors and images agree. 
  It's that he always screws it up. He has an
  anti-ear, and it's absolutely infallible;
  he is a Joyce or a Flaubert in reverse, 
  incapable of rendering even the smallest 
  details without genius. The difference 
  between Friedman and an ordinary bad 
  writer is that an ordinary bad writer will, 
  say, call some businessman a shark and 
  have him say some tired, uninspired piece 
  of dialogue: Friedman will have him spout 
  it. And that's guaranteed, every single 
  time. He never misses.
