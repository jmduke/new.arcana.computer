The latest entries in the MCU aren’t just mediocre to forgettable to outright bad, they don’t even have the ambition to be about anything. What is this about? Love? Not really. Family? That is mostly tacked on at the end. There is no there, here. No larger theme, no apparent interest in anything other than the quips, plot and cameos.

THOR: LOVE AND THUNDER is worse than bad, it’s a waste of time.
