I become grateful to wake up every day knowing how I will spend it. Iâ€™m not building a cathedral, but I think about what building a cathedral would let me do, how it would allow me to move my hands in a task and see something monumental grow very slowly, with immense care. A bricklayer understands brick in a way that is devotional.

Repetition is devotional.
