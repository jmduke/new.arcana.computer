It is often regretted that children can no longer
play or move freely outside because of the dangers
of traffic; inevitably, many of the people who voice
these regrets are also the drivers of cars, as those same
restricted children will come to be in their time.
What is being mourned, it seems, is not so much the
decline of an old world of freedom as the existence of
comforts and conveniences the individual feels pow-
erless to resist, and which in any case he or she could
not truthfully say they wished would be abolished.
