One interesting thing that I've noticed about Stripe engineering culture (comparing 5 years ago vs today) is that it's now *easier* in some ways to make large, sweeping decisions. Previously, these decisions would get a lot of scrutiny from many senior ICs. Today, the org is so big that senior ICs can't keep an eye on everything.
