1. Cutting down trees spoils the beauty of the landscape. I would
not like to live where there were no trees.
2. There are few birds where there are no trees. They have no
place to make their homes.
3. Taking away the trees takes away the protection from our
tender fruit trees.
Where there are no trees the snows melt and go off too rapid-
ly; the moisture that should sink into the soil is carried awav in the
floods.
Because our forests are taken away we have severe droughts
every year.
6.
One full grown elm tree gives out fifteen tons of moisture in
twenty-four hours.
A large sunflower plant gives off three pints of
water in one day.
7.
The trees give us lumber, fuel, wood, pulp for newspapers,
cork, bark for tanning, wild fruits, nuts, resin, turpentine oils and
various products for medicines.
8. We should have greater extremes of heat and cold if it were
not for the trees and forests.
9. The leaves of trees catch the rain and hold it a little while;
then they drop the water a little at a time; this is better for the
ground.
10. The old leaves make a deep sponge carpet in the woods and
this keeps the ground from freezing. If the earth does not freeze it
takes up the rain better.
