It is rare indeed that people give. Most people guard and keep; they suppose that it is they themselves that they are guarding and keeping, whereas what they are actually guarding and keeping is their system of reality and what they assume themselves to be. One can give nothing whatever without giving oneselfâ€“that is to say, risking oneself. If one cannot risk oneself, then one is simply incapable of giving.
