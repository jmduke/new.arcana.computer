One of my dad’s biggest pieces of business advice was this: “don’t go out of business.” He graduated from a photography program and became a professional photographer along with many of his classmates, and then over the course of a decade or so, a lot of them gave up or went out of business. Obviously it’s a joke - that the path to success is avoiding failure. But there’s some wisdom to the idea that just continuing to exist is a priority. Just surviving can give you an advantage.
