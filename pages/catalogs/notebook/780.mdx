Schooling has to do with gaining access to skills but there is no transformation. Education is about the formation of attention…you attend to things that matter. It’s about the cultivation of a self so that you’re able to have a sense of who you are based on integrity, honesty and decency…It is about the maturation of a soul that you learn how to muster the courage to think critically, the courage to love, to stay in contact with the humanity of others.
