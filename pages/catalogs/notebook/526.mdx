Listen to me, girls: Do you know the story of the prime rib roast? A woman invites some people over for dinner. She puts a superb five-pound roast on the kitchen counter. The guests arrive, she  talks with them fora while in the living room, they drink a few martinis. Then she slips out to the kitchen to prepare the roast... and sees it's disappeared. Who does she see licking the chops in a corner? The cat."

"I know what happened," says the elder daughter.

"All right, what?"

"The cat ate the roast."

"You believe that? You're not dumb, but wait. The guests come rushing in and discuss what's happened. The five-pound roast has disappeared into thin air, the cat looks happy and well-fed. Everyone concludes the same thing as you."

"Then one of the guests suggests, 'What if we weighed it, just to be sure?"

"They're all a bit drunk, and think it's a great idea. They take the cat into the bathroom and put it on the scale. It weighs exactly five pounds. The guest who suggested weighing the cat says, 'There you go, the numbers add up. Now we can be sure of what happened."

"But then another guest scratches his head and says, 'Okay, now we know where the five-pound roast is. But then where's the cat?"
