[31] Ask yourself on some cadence: why does the team/project exist? If it didnâ€™t exist, what would happen (which other team / system would fill the gap)? How is the team adding value to the company and how can it continue doing so in the future?

[32] Keep track of every other major project in your space within the company: you should be able to explain their technical design better than their own ICs. Grab any opportunities to debate scope with the leads of other similar projects: you should be able to articulate how your project fits into the larger ecosystem of options. Inter-team competition is healthy and necessary. Make friends with ICs in these projects: they understand your technical challenges better than anyone else in the company.

[33] Do not compete on raw performance or efficiency with other teams; this will escalate into an arms race where both teams waste time optimizing their systems for point workloads, generating apples-to-oranges comparisons, etc. Compete on fundamental design characteristics.

[34] If someone objectively has a better system for your use case and wants to take it on, go find something else to do.
