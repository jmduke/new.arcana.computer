One disability rights advocate and blogger, Dave Hinsburger http://davehingsburger.blogspot.com, has proposed what he calls (if I remember right) the “midnight burrito test”: Can a resident wake up in the middle of the night and zap themselves a burrito for a late night snack just because they feel like it?  If no, then it is probably an institution.
