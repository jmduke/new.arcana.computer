I think my main takeaway from this experience was that when you buy from a vendor, you can’t help but buy a little of their culture along with the product. In the cases where that vendor is particularly strategic (say, a major infrastructure provider), you need to be OK with whatever bleed that vendor’s culture will have into yours.
