I would have liked to have made a difference, to thunder my opinions  loudly, so all would listen, all would understand, but all I can do is whisper, sometimes.

I am 62 this weekend, so will probably die soon, or get alzheimers or be rendered insane. I would love my 5 mins of fame while I can appreciate it all, please retweet, I would love to go global.. just once, one last chance to prove I existed.
