Harrington took seriously the necessity of believing in ordinary people
Often he told campus audiences, "If you consider your country capable of dem-ocratic socialism, you must do two things. First you must deeply love and trust your country. You must sense the dignity and humanity of the people who survive and grow within your country despite the injustices of its system. And second, you must recognize that the social vision to which you are committing yourself will never be fulfilled in your lifetime." Sometimes he put it with a Christianized gloss: "I am running toward the kingdom of humanity and I am aware that I will never see it. Perhaps no one will."
