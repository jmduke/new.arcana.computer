I saw all those people suddenly changing from indie software companies who made something with their labor and sold it and got money â€” those people would get money from their customers. Back in those days you would get checks for shareware. Or putting in credit cards online and getting their money and giving them a code or whatever. All of those people would suddenly change from that form of income to a new form of income. And that new form of income was every month you would get a single check signed from Apple.
