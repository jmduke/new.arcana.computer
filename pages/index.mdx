Hello! <strong>arcana dot computer</strong> is a weblog from <strong>Justin Duke</strong>. (That's me.)

I run [Buttondown](https://buttondown.email), maintain [ Spoonbill](https://spoonbill.io), and invest at [Third South Capital](https://thirdsouth.capital/).

Before that, I spent four years at [Stripe](https://stripe.com), where I did things like:

- building [data products](https://stripe.com/sigma) into mature
  lines of business
- managing reporting infrastructure & components used by hundreds of thousands
  of merchants
- running and scaling Stripe's Product Quality initiative

I also have a [very nice Corgi puppy](https://www.instagram.com/itstellybelly) and mentor aspiring technologists in partnership with [Unloop](https://www.un-loop.org). With what precious time remains, I generally am probably reading or writing or playing some video games. Here's what I've currently got on tap:

<CurrentlyWidget items={currently} />

If you're
interested in subscribing to [monthly updates](https://newsletter.arcana.computer) from this project, you should subscribe below or via the [omnibus RSS feed](/rss/omnibus.xml):

<div className="py-4">
  <SubscribeForm />
</div>

Alternatively, you can jump right into some writing.
This domain is an ongoing work: links below that are slightly faded are drafts, and unclickable links
are placeholders for future content.
You're welcome to peruse them, of course, and you might also enjoy [my shorter, more blog-y posts](/blog).

At the moment, I'm not looking for a position — I am happily spending my time working on Buttondown and cosplaying as a house husband. That being said, if you're interested in a full _professional history_, as they say, you can find it right here:

  items={[
    {
      left: <span className="tabular-nums">2018 — 2022</span>,
      right: (

            power the Stripe dashboard. Built out a team & interviewed around a
            thousand people. Ran Product Quality.

      ),
    },

      ),
    },

    },

Lastly, if you're interested in chatting, please reach out. I am in general much happier to answer an email or DM than jump on a call.
