Hello! <strong>arcana dot computer</strong> is a weblog from <strong>Justin Duke</strong>. (That's me.)

I run [Buttondown](https://buttondown.email) and [  Spoonbill](https://spoonbill.io). Before that, I spent four years at [Stripe](https://stripe.com), where I did things like:

- building [data products](https://stripe.com/sigma) into mature
  lines of business
- managing reporting infrastructure & components used by hundreds of thousands
  of merchants
- running and scaling Stripe's Product Quality initiative

I also have a [very nice Corgi puppy](https://www.instagram.com/itstellybelly) and mentor aspiring technologists in partnership with [Unloop](https://www.un-loop.org). With what precious time remains, I generally am either playing video games with [my fianc√©](https://www.instagram.com/burtonhf/), watching basketball, or writing for this very web site.

Alternatively, you can jump right into some writing.
This domain is an ongoing work: links below that are slightly faded are drafts, and unclickable links
are placeholders for future content.
You're welcome to peruse them, of course, and you might also enjoy [my shorter, more blog-y posts](/catalogs/snippets).

I love getting random tweets and emails, I promise.
