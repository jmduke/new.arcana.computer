Hello! <strong>arcana dot computer</strong> is a weblog from <strong>Justin Duke</strong>. (That's me.)

I run [Buttondown](https://buttondown.email) and [ Spoonbill](https://spoonbill.io). Before that, I spent four years at [Stripe](https://stripe.com), where I did things like:

- building [data products](https://stripe.com/sigma) into mature
  lines of business
- managing reporting infrastructure & components used by hundreds of thousands
  of merchants
- running and scaling Stripe's Product Quality initiative

I also have a [very nice Corgi puppy](https://www.instagram.com/itstellybelly) and mentor aspiring technologists in partnership with [Unloop](https://www.un-loop.org). With what precious time remains, I generally am probably reading or writing or playing some video games. Here's what I've currently got on tap:

<CurrentlyWidget />

If you're
interested in subscribing to monthly updates from this project, you should subscribe below or via the [omnibus RSS feed](/rss/omnibus.xml):

<div className="py-4">
  <SubscribeForm />
</div>

Alternatively, you can jump right into some writing.
This domain is an ongoing work: links below that are slightly faded are drafts, and unclickable links
are placeholders for future content.
You're welcome to peruse them, of course, and you might also enjoy [my shorter, more blog-y posts](/catalogs/snippets).

<TableOfContents />

Lastly, if you're interested in chatting, please reach out. I am in general much happier to answer an email or DM than jump on a call.
